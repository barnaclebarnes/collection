    "description": "Recto: From the right to left edges, the five band members (see Verso below for details) are featured in an all over pattern of eight rows in various standing poses, imprinted in tones of red or black-and-white. The band's name, The Atlantics, is imprinted across in the second, fourth and sixth rows in sans serif type of the same height as the figures, which are displaced by the letters for the most part in those rows. \n\nVerso: A sequence of five overlapping, black and white, partial head shot views, one of each band member, comprises the design. The subjects look directly at the viewer and are posed so that the facial components - eyes, noses, mouths, etc - are approximately on the same level. The musicians' names and functions are imprinted at different levels in red sans serif style capitals; from left to right, they are Paul Caruso\/ Drums, Vocals; B. Wilkinson\/ Bass Guitar, Vocals; Fred Pineau\/ Lead Guitar; Tom Hauck\/ Guitar, Vocals; and Bobby Marron\/ Lead Vocals. Can't Wait Forever and Lonely Hearts, the album's two song titles, are imprinted respectively in the top and bottom quarters overlaying the second through fourth views.  Additional production credits are interspersed, and Design\/ M&Co appears in the lower right hand corner.",
