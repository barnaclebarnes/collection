    "description": "Task chair of black mesh stretch fabric within black frame consisting of contoured back, broad contoured seat with sloping front edge, adjustment mechanism under seat; black, adjustable padded arm supports; base consisting of vertical post on five radiating feet with casters.",
    "justification": "This chair was introduced to the market in November 1994\u2014too late, unfortunately, to be included in our exhibition that fall, Good Offices and Beyond: A Laboratory of Seating. The chair represents a number of design innovations in materials and ergonomics. It has a lightweight plastic frame and comfortable fiber mesh upholstery that molds to the shape of a body when sitting but returns to its original shape when empty. The seat tilts backward or forward to accommodate specific tasks, the armrests move in four directions, and the back has a moveable lumbar support. The chair also comes in three sizes to fit different body shapes.",
    "gallery_text": "Today, the Aeron and similar chairs are ubiquitous in offices, libraries, and even residences. But before Bill Stumpf and Don Chadwick, working as independent contractors, developed the Aeron chair with manufacturer Herman Miller, releasing it in 1994, the typical office chair was oversized and upholstered. The Aeron was revolutionary, upending the popular understanding of \u201cexecutive chair\u201d to one that is comfortable, functional, slim, and modern. Unlike traditional furnishing upholstery, the mesh fabric, called Pellicle, offers breathability and is easy to clean; it also subtly responds to the sitter\u2019s form, returning to neutral once the sitter stands. The chair is intended to accommodate, without needing manual adjustments, three types of sitting: forward, for using office equipment; slightly reclined, for conversations and computer browsing; and deeply reclined, for reading and resting. All adjustments can be made while seated and in any position, feet remain on the floor, the back stays supported, and the Kinemat tilt mechanism, as Herman Miller describes it, \u201clets your neck, shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles pivot naturally.\u201d Three sizes were created to accommodate different heights after the designers\u2019 prototype tests found one chair size would not work for everyone.",
