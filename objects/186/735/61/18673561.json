Woolsey's Newberry Or- \/ gan is the third largest in the world, \/ making the interaction between \/ the 120 member Yale Symphony \/ and James Meehan at te organ  about equal in decibel potential.\nAt lower center, footnote 2 in script: the last work completed by the \/ composer before his death in 1911. \/ Its profound lyricism was seen by \/ the composer not only as a farewell \/ to life but a farewell to the lush \/ romantic style he had perfected.\nAt lower right, footnote 3 in script: first heard in 1913 and seen by many \/ to be the begining of the modern \/ era of music. Its unprecedented \/ rhythmic complexity coupled with \/ the primal simplicity of its musical \/ ideas make it Stravinski's most \/ famous and infamous works. \/ John Mauceri begins his sixth season \/ as music director of the orchestra \/ with this concert.",
