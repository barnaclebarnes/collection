    "gallery_text": "This chair is a prototype for one of the twentieth century\u2019s most iconic modernist furniture designs, Mies van der Rohe\u2019s Barcelona chair of 1929. The Barcelona chair is a design of contradictions. Mies, one-time director of the innovative German Bauhaus design school, is a stringent modern designer. The Barcelona chair, however, references ancient x-shaped folding chairs used by Egyptian rulers, Greek gods and mortal rulers, and Roman magistrates. The two chairs designed by Mies and introduced at the Barcelona World\u2019s Fair German Pavilion (from where it received its name) similarly displayed power, as they were used by the Spanish king and queen during an inaugural ceremony. Although this prototype offers an industrial machine aesthetic, the steel was hand-forged, the screw holes hand-drilled, and the hemp straps hand-tied\u2014a labor-intensive process that, together with expensive seat and back cushion upholstery, made the chair unaffordable. Later models were instead made of chrome-plated steel or aluminum. Additional variances in later models include a slightly narrower frame with thinner steel bands and a protruding seat edge over the runners that was later pulled back. In 1948, American manufacturer Knoll began producing the Barcelona chair, and it has since been a staple of high-end corporate offices and lobbies, a signifier of modernist taste and discourse.",
