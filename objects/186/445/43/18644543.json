    "description": "Each of the seven mailing labels in this suite features a different black and white photograph, washed in pale green; the M&Co name, address and telephone number imprinted in white just below the top edge; and a white rectangle, imprinted with five thin pale green horizontal lines to accommodate addressee information, superimposed in the center of the photograph.\n\n1993-151-188a, Dog - The head and neck of a dog (perhaps a German shepherd), facing right and with fangs bared, comprises the profile view.\n\n1993-151-188b, Fruit Dish - A footed dish, probably all silver or glass with a silver base, holds a variety of fruits: grapes, a pear, a banana, an apple.\n\n1993-151-188c, Sidewalk Art Show - A variety of framed works of art (paintings, drawings, prints) is arranged in rows on a sidewalk. Across from left to right, just below the top edge, the legs and feet of viewers are visible in back of the display.\n\n1993-151-188d, Seated Swimmer - A woman, dressed in a bathing suit and cap, is posed seated on the ground near a body of water. In this profile view, her eyes are closed and her head rests on her arms, which are folded across her knees. \n\n1993-151-188e, Pedicab - A man, posed in the center, pedals a pedicab, in which a woman passenger is seated in the back. The man wears a tweed sport jacket; a striped scarf tied around his neck; and laced shoes. The woman, smiling, is dressed in a dark coat and turned-up-brimmed hat; her lap is covered by a plaid blanket. The grassy surface is backed by a row of tall hedges, hemmed in by a gated structure.\n\n1993-151-188f, Carton Stack - In this view, probably set in a supermarket storage space or warehouse, cartons, labeled according to the product within, are stacked top to bottom. In the top left, several boxes (e.g., Kellogg's Snack-Pak, Nabisco 100% Bran) are askew, as if about to tumble down.\n\n1993-151-188g, Laboratory - Two men work together in a laboratory. On the left, the standing man, his face visible above the nose, glances down at the table, on which the other man, seated, writes with a pencil on a pad. Also on the table are flasks and bottles, on the left, and a microscope, on the right. Additional bottles, labelled appear on shelves in the background.\n\n1993-151-188h, Fonts - This object differs in some respects from the others in the series: it is smaller; the addressee section comprises four horizontal lines rather than five; and the M&Co information is imprinted in black on one line at the top of that section. The design features printers' font samples in pale green on black laid out helter skelter on a flat surface.",
