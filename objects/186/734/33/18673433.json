Along the left edge in white letters reading from upper left to lower left, METEORS AND METAPHORS \/ ENLARGING THE DESIGN PERSPECTIVE. At upper left are yellow radiating letters.\nVerso: Reading horizontaly left from right, the scheduled events, programs and lectures are presented in black type against a white ground.
