    "gallery_text": "Designed in 1969, this poster features the manipulation of imagery and text, long before digital programs such as Photoshop made the process indispensable to graphic designers. Friedman merges two black-and-white photographs of the German artist Otto Piene\u2019s art installation and adds text in a way that is reminiscent of the International Style. Although looking to establish his own unique style, Friedman borrows from early Modernist approaches to design at the turn of the twentieth century.   Friedman studied in Basel during the 1960s and Swiss design is a marked influence.",
