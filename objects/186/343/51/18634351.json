    "description": "Wrought iron stand (d) on three legs, with tendril curls of iron to create struts between legs, and to form overhanging curved handle.

Pot with brass handles and cylindrical ebony handle, which hangs from overhanging iron stand above a copper burner (c).",
    "justification": "Christopher Dresser (1834\u20131904) held a position of considerable importance in the history of design during the 19th century. His published theories on design were based on the importance of an object\u2019s functionality and the simplicity of botanical forms. Unlike many of his peers, he recognized the implications of mechanized production and integrated an understanding of industrial processes into the development of his designs, which were produced by various manufacturing companies.\nThis kettle and stand, manufactured by Benham and Froud, are today rarely seen together as a pair. The kettle illustrates Dresser\u2019s desire for undecorated, geometric forms. The stand, with its intertwined tendril-like forms, reflects his interest in botany.",
    "gallery_text": "Christopher Dresser, a successful commercial designer working in many media, realized some of his most innovative work in metal. Fascinated by Japanese design, he helped fuel the late nineteenth-century European and American rage for that country\u2019s aesthetic. Traditional Japanese metalware inspired this kettle\u2019s simple, geometric form, considered revolutionary at the time. Dresser was also a trained botanist, and his interest in plantlife can be seen in the stand\u2019s tendril-like form.",
