The exhibition included the work of eighty-four designers from around the world to demonstrate the global importance of environmental issues. While these posters were previously made, ten US designers, including Rand, were commissioned to create new posters pro bono. The ten posters were printed either with dryography, a water- and alcohol-free printing process, and vegetable-based inks; or using specially made recycled paper. Rand\u2019s use of a grid of green hearts and one single red heart suggests the human connection to the environment. Repetition and bold colors were characteristic of his work.",
