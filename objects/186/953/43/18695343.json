    "gallery_text": "In the 1950s, IBM hired Eliot Noyes as design consultant to revamp the company\u2019s identity. Noyes subsequently hired modern graphic artist Paul Rand, who designed the iconic striped IBM logo as well as various packaging, posters, and other design work for which he became renowned as a leading corporate designer. Rand\u2019s IBM logo was intended to give consistency to the letters, each of which is wider than the last. The striped letters, with eight- and thirteen-bar variants, suggest speed, dynamism, and make the ordinary block letters less standard, and therefore more memorable. In this poster, Rand has replaced the first two letters with pictograms while retaining the \u201cM\u201d of what by this time had become iconic. He claimed that the \u201cB\u201d and \u201cI\u201d were the least likely letters in the alphabet to be misinterpreted in a rebus. Rand has described the rebus as \u201ca kind of game designed to engage the reader and, incidentally, lots of fun.\u201d Further, the rebus humanized the corporate giant while maintaining reference to its iconic striped letters. The in-house poster was considered so successful that IBM has continued printing the design for other purposes and in variant forms.",
    "label_text": "This famous poster is an example of a rebus. We read the pictures of the eye and the bee as sounds, spelling out the company name: IBM. Using pictures to represent sounds is the basis of various writing systems, including Egyptian hieroglyphs. The striped version of the logo, which Rand designed in 1972, remains in use today.",
