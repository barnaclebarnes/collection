    "justification": "Maharam, a fourth-generation family textile company, approached Hella Jongerius in 2001 with an open objective: to create a single textile that would permit a suite of chairs around a table to be \u201ccousins\u201d\u2014each unique but all related. Jongerius\u2019 design vocabulary, which plays on the concept of random order, personalization of industrial processes, and manipulation of traditional manufacturing methods and materials, lent itself ideally to this concept.\n \nThe collaboration with Maharam resulted in Repeat, a set of patterns designed by Jongerius that introduces new dimension and context to upholstery textiles. Repeat is comprised of a series of patterns, each based on a single theme, seamlessly flowing into one another yard after yard. Repeat Classic is a repeat of archetypal jacquard motifs, while Repeat Dot unfurls into a modernist sequence of varied circular forms. In this textile proposed for acquisition, Repeat Dot Print, Jongerius embellishes further, combining the industrial vocabulary of the weaving process with a layer of white lacquer overprint.\nRepeat Classic, Repeat Dot, and their overprinted variations, like Repeat Dot Print, are each available as panels in unique colorations. A series of four elements drawn from Repeat Classic and Repeat Dot is offered in a range of colors, providing the opportunity to mix, match, or mismatch. Through the unexpected use of pattern and exaggerated scale, the Repeat series creates random order as fabric meets furniture with a predictable yet uncertain result.",
