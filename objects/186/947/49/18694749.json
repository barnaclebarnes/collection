    "justification": "Like Paul Rand, Ladislav Sutnar, and Bradbury Thompson, Alvin Lustig (1915\u20131955) was an innovative pioneer in developing American graphic design during the 1940s and 1950s. Lustig\u2019s early work in the late 1930s reflects his training with Frank Lloyd Wright. Lustig's subsequent work evolved to adapt the powerful, visual language of cubism, constructivism, Dada, the Bauhaus, surrealism, biomorphism, and abstraction to designs for book jackets, identity programs, record covers, and interiors. Tragically, he did not live beyond two decades of his promising career as a leading graphic designer and educator.\nThis book cover is part of a larger proposed gift of Lustig\u2019s work that would immeasurably strengthen the museum\u2019s graphic design representation from the 1930s through the 1950s, which currently includes works by E. M. Kauffer, Rand, Sutnar, Lester Beall, and World War II propaganda posters. It would also join Lustig works already in the collection, received in 1993 as a gift from his widow, graphic designer Elaine Lustig Cohen, which include book jacket designs for Meridian Books\/Noonday Press and New Directions. Acquiring additional works by Lustig also increases the potential for a contextual understanding of graphic design objects by Cohen held in the museum\u2019s collection; Cohen\u2019s early graphic design career and design vision was greatly influenced by working with her first husband. Moreover, the Lustig gift would provide a broader representation of the visual vocabulary reflected in industrial design, textiles and wall coverings of the period. \nMost of Lustig\u2019s designs for paperback books, record covers, trade catalogues, announcements, invitations, letterhead do not survive in pristine condition\u2014if they survive at all\u2014because his designs were for ephemeral objects that were constantly used. This proposed gift is additionally desirable because it was preserved for more than four decades by Lustig\u2019s sister, Susan Lustig Peck. \n(December 17, 2001)",
