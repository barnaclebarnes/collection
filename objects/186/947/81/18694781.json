Beard\/\"The Law of Civilization and Decay is a magnificent book, daring in\/conception and brilliant in execution. It offers clue after clue to the\/major riddles of history, while it corrects scholars of the statue of\/Gibbon and Marx. The treatment of the Reformation anticipated Max\/Weber, the effect of geography on politics facilitated source material for the German geopolitician, Haushofer; the cyclical theory preceded\/Spengler; the influence of economics on law antedated Beard; and the respect for technology foreshadowed Veblen.\"\/Arthur Beringause, Brooks Adams: A Biography\/Of the Law of Civilization and Decay, Henry Adams wrote:\/\"I think it is astonishing. Indeed it is the first time that serious history\/has ever been written. He has done for it what only the greatest men\/do; he has created a startling generalisation that has reduced all history\/to a scientific formula, which is yet so simple and so obvious that\/one cannot believe it to be new. My admiration for it is much to great\/to be told. I have sought all my life these truths which this mighty\/infant, this seer unblest, has struck with agony and bloody sweat\/of genius. I stand in awe of him.\"\/A VINTAGE BOOK\/Cover design by Alvin Lustig.",
