    "description": "Recto: A reproduction of a painting of a face, partial frontal view, beginning about an inch from the top, continues to the bottom edge, ending just below the lips. The eyes are dark and reflect pinpoints of light, the brows are heavy, the nose is shadowed on the proper right, and the full lips are pale pink. Talking Heads, imprinted in blue capitals on the right above the nose, ends at the right edge. The video title, in smaller red capitals, is imprinted vertically near the left edge in the space between the lower eyelid and the upper lip.\nSide panels: The face continues on the side panels, with the eyes and brows ending at the verso edges. Talking Heads, again in blue capitals, is imprinted on two lines on each panel. In the right panel, the facial flesh extends beyond the verso edge into the verso, and the video title is imprinted in red in the same format as on the recto. In the left panel, the facial area below the eye ends in a curve against a dark brown background, and the album title, again in small red capitals, is imprinted in a curve following the facial edge. \nVerso: The flesh tone of the facial portrait continues on the left (see Side Panels, above); the video title is imprinted on the right of the this top left section and the names of the band personnel, followed by Talking Heads,\nare imprinted slightly below to the left. A narrative description of the video content completes this section. The story titles, in white type on a brown background (which might depict the hair of the portrait subject), are listed vertically on the right. In about two thirds of the space in the lower half, there is reproduction of a 1930's black and white photograph of a man, woman, teenage boy and younger girl standing in a row; an actual male giant, his hands on the shoulders of the two end figures in the front row, is standing behind them. Everyone is smiling; they appear to be a family group. Part of a house with a peaked roof is on the left behind the group and trees in leaf are on the right. Brief biographical facts about the giant are imprinted on six lines in small black type to the left of the photograph. Production data in white on a brown rectangle, which overlays part of the photograph, is on the left bottom.\nTop flap: Where the lower edge of the flap meets the recto, Talking Heads in blue capitals, followed by the video title in red, are imprinted in small capitals. The flap closes in the direction of the verso.",
