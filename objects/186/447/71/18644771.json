    "description": "The cover design, based on a color transparency by the photographer, William Wegman, is reproduced in tones ranging from dark brown to orange-pink. The principal feature of the design, situated in the right half of the page, is a dog of the Weimaraner breed, with a brown, smooth-textured coat; his head is slightly tilted to the left, he stares directly at the viewer, and his wide-opened eyes and floppy ears are highlighted. He stands with his legs wide apart atop a small chest fabricated in the Louis XVth revival style; the side door of the chest, open on the left, is gilt-trimmed, as are the curved legs and front panel. An easy chair, upholstered in fabric, perhaps velvet, and trimmed at bottom with fringe, is placed in the center left background. There is a hazy, partial view of a black and white dog stretched out in the chair. The painted walls are scraped on the right, as if the paint has worn off or a new color sample has been applied. The parquet floor is scratched in several places. \n\nThe cover refers to the term \"dogumenta,\" a pun on Documenta 8, the international art show in progress at the time the present Artforum was issued. (See \"The Tale That Wags The Dog\")",
