    "description": "The box-shaped jacket, closed on three sides, is constructed of coated black, marbleized stock, notched on the edge in the center of the open side, front and back. There is an incised outline of a heart in the center, front.\n\nBook, front and back covers: Dark green cloth; spine bound in black cloth, extending about two inches each onto front and back. \n\nFront cover:  Imprinted in metallic gold, a heart, pierced on the diagonal by an upward-pointing arrow, is positioned underneath the incised outline of the jacket, through which the gold color is visible.\n\nSpine: With the object laid flat, back cover down, A Romance is imprinted horizontally in gold lower case, the a italicized, the remainder in sans-serif type; with the object standing, M&Co\/ Vol.4, imprinted just above the bottom edge, may be viewed.\n\nInside front cover: Within a centered square, outlined in black, is a photographic close-up facial view, aborted on all four sides, of the faces of a man and woman on the verge of kissing. Their eyes are closed and lips parted; on the left, the man is in front of the woman and in shadow; the woman emerges from shadow into bright light. About half-way down, directly underneath, yes is imprinted in miniature type.\n\nInner spine: A twelve-word quotation, one word per line, is imprinted top to bottom.\n\nInside back cover: An uncovered wooden box, fastened here, is divided into seven \nsections, six of which are lined with beige paper, with one-word labels relating to the overall theme of romance, as well as to the specific contents; the seventh features a color illustration. On the left, spanning the full length of the box, a compartment holds two white tapered candles, their wicks attached. The word melt is imprinted on a curve in the center. In the upper half-length center section, labeled taste, a curve-sided tin is covered by white paper featuring two horseshoe shapes, their curves facing left and right, surrounding the word, oysters; three stylized electrical bolts jutting out top and bottom, complete the arrangement. Below this, two toothpicks, one underneath the other, are inserted in the paper cover. The top compartment in the lower center section holds a white envelope; the design is composed of an illustration in outline of two intertwined condoms (cover flap), a vertically positioned thermometer at low temperature (left inner flap), another thermometer at high temperature (right inner flap), and two packaged condoms (inside the envelope). The compartment lining shows a view of fireworks in white on a predominantly red background. The tripartite section beneath extends to the bottom and right edges: in the left compartment, labeled breathe, is a round tin of Tabu mints, an Italian brand; in the center, labeled spark, is a matchbox showing a log fire, curling upward; on the right, labeled burn, are four green incense pellets. The remaining compartment, labeled laugh, on the right and above the tripartite segment, holds a feather.",
