    "description": "Album cover, Recto: At top is a narrow red border with the album's title, centered, imprinted in white capitals; at bottom, an identical border, with Live 2 LP Set (1980-1981), centered, in capitals, and song titles in smaller capitals on each side. Five horizontal rows of color photographs of the band members in performance, shot indoors and brightly lighted, with brown and red tones predominant, complete the design.\nVerso (In reverse top-to-bottom order from the recto): The top and bottom border design of the recto is repeated here in black. At top the album's name is imprinted in white italicized capitals and at bottom, Live 2 LP Set (1977-1979), also in italicized capitals, is centered, with song titles on both sides. Three rows of square, nighttime photographs of the band in performance, clearly lighted but lacking highlights, complete the design.\nSleeve 1977-1979, Recto: The narrow white border at the top shows the album title, centered, imprinted in black italics. The design comprises eight horizontal rows, each showing eight square photographs of the band's musicians, seen either in individual head shots or in groups, either in black-to-brown and white tones or in color. Underneath the white border and then following every second row are thin black bands, imprinted in white capitals with the musicans' names  and other production information.\nVerso: With the recto's black and white scheme reversed within the narrow border at the top, the album title, centered, is imprinted in italics. The design format of the recto is replicated, with the exception that here the top row and every second row are bordered by thin black bands, imprinted in white with the musicians' names and roles, as well as with additional production information. (M&Co. is identified as the designer toward the center of the second band from the top.)\nSleeve 1980-1981, Recto: Following a design similar to the 1977-1979 sleeve, there is a red border at top imprinted in white capitals with the album title. in the present sleeve, eight rows of eight photographs in black and white or in color, of musicians, individually or in groups, are divided horizontally by thin black bands, imprinted in white capitals with musicians' names and production information. On the right of the sixth row, TWA appears in italicized capitals on a sign such as would\nappear at an airport; within the sign, Talking Heads is scribbled in capitals below TWA.\nVerso: The design replicates the recto's format, but here the photographs of the band's personnel include both performance and behind-the-scenes content.",
