    "justification": "The Delman Shoe Company appears on the Henry Dreyfuss client list in the Dreyfuss archives at Cooper-Hewitt. The archives also contain microfilm with a design for an advertisement or sign for Delman, dated 1929. Although this drawing is neither dated nor annotated with a client name, it is stamped \"property of Henry Dreyfuss\u201d on the verso and appears to be a shoe design from about 1929 by Dreyfuss for Delman.\nThis is one of three shoe drawings proposed for acquisition. The addition of these drawings to the Dreyfuss archives would provide yet another facet of Dreyfuss\u2019s early career and demonstrates the variety of projects that industrial designers, such as Dreyfuss, undertook prior to the 1930s.",
    "gallery_text": "As a budding industrial designer, Henry Dreyfuss took on a variety of odd jobs in the late 1920s. For one, he designed temporary exhibitions for Delman\u2019s, a high-end shoe company that sold hand-made products from its Madison Avenue storefront. In 1924, Dreyfuss had left fellow designer Norman Bel Geddes\u2019s firm to become a freelance theatrical stage designer. This interest\u2014which resulted in his designing five Broadway stage sets by 1930\u2014must have translated well to shop windows. This design for a shoe, one of three in Cooper Hewitt's collection, may have been intended to be used in a window display, as it shows a penchant for the theatrical. It is unknown if Dreyfuss\u2019s shoe designs were ever produced, but within a few years, he was a sought-after designer working for many types of manufacturers, particularly of domestic goods. He aimed to improve ordinary people\u2019s lives through high-quality, affordable goods. This c. 1929 drawing, then, can be considered part of his transition from designing for the theater to designing for daily life.",
