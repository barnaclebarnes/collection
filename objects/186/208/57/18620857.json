    "gallery_text": "Christopher Dresser is often called the first industrial designer: he served as a freelance designer to a variety of firms and worked in many media, including clay, which he valued for its inexpensive price, malleability, and ability to absorb color. In 1879, he helped found the Linthorpe Art Pottery in Middlesbrough, England, and served as art superintendent until 1882. Although the pottery was only open for a decade, it produced some of the earliest art ceramics in England and became an industry leader, manufacturing well-crafted and affordable products. Critics praised Linthorpe\u2019s wares for their beautiful colors, brilliant glazes, and variety of shapes. Each shape was given a number that was impressed on its underside in its Plaster-of-Paris mold; this pitcher is shape number 611. Also seen on the underside are HT\u2014for Henry Tooth, master potter\u2014Dresser\u2019s facsimile signature, and the pottery stamp. Dresser was influenced by a variety of sources, most notably Japanese designs, botany, and classical Greek forms\u2014the latter of which most likely inspired this pitcher, with its upturned lip. Dresser, through Linthorpe and other ventures, helped to raise the status of pottery from a functional necessity to an affordable artistic collectible.",
