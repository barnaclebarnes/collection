Designing patterns primarily for use within the architecture and interior design trade, his clients included many of the leading producers of mid-century modern furniture and fabrics, including Herman Miller, Knoll Associates, and Jens Risom.\nLittle is known about how the IBM fabric was used or how closely Rand and Testa worked on the design. When IBM premiered its boxy, geometric logotype in 1956, designed by Paul Rand, the idea of a coordinated corporate identity system was just taking off. Indeed, Rand\u2019s logo design set the mark for a new standard of graphic communication in business. A corporate identity was intended to be more than a logo, however: it was conceived as a broader program encompassing signage, letterheads, packaging, publications, and more. By presenting the logo in several line weights as well as in solid blue, Rand and Testa imparted a varied tone and texture to the overall pattern of this textile design.",

Studying there with modernist pioneers L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, Gyorgy Kepes, and Marli Ehrman (a weaver), Testa was the school\u2019s first graduate. After founding his own firm in 1947, he went on to create original textiles in a bold, painterly style.
