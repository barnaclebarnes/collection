    "description": "Selection of wallpaper samples, bound in embossed black paper cover. Red glob (wax?) on center of cover. Contains combination sets of matching papers which include sidewall, frieze and ceiling papers. Does contain oatmeal papers, cut out borders and several selections of intaglio printed papers for kitchen and bath. Also grape cluster papers for dining rooms. The cut out borders are die cut as some samples still retain their cut off elements.",
    "justification": "This 1915 sample book by the Alfred Peats Company is from the Decorators Wall Paper Co., the Vermont distributing agent for Peats. Peats was not the manufacturer of these wallpapers, but acted as the jobber or distributor. Many different manufacturers\u2019 names can be found on the selvedges, including Imperial of Glens Falls, New York; Gledhill of New York City; and Becker, Smith & Page of Philadelphia.\nSample books are important part of the museum\u2019s wallpaper collection because they contain the entire range of designs produced in a given year, including papers made to be hung together. Details such as prices and decorating advice are often offered. \nWallpaper designs were usually available for one year, unless a pattern proved to be an excellent seller. This book is one of four sample books from Peats from 1915 under consideration. It is unusual to find four sample books from the same company within the same year. Together, these books provide an effective illustration of how the industry worked at the time.",
