    "description": "Four rectangular landscapes depicting pastoral scenes of figures, horses, cows and dogs. The frames simulate grained molding. Between each frame is a rosette. All frames are heavily highlighted and shaded. The scenes are divided in alternating rows of two each.",

    "gallery_text": "The framework of this wallpaper captures a format of \u201cpostcard\u201d views popularized during the second half of the 19th century. This format was available in a wide variety of block or tile styles, from rustic to more sophisticated, with each paper usually containing 3-6 different scenes, with adjoining tiles always having different views. As most if not all of these block-format papers were machine-printed the pattern repeats were quite small, usually 18 inches, so the maximum number of different scenes was limited.\n \nThis paper contains scenes of cowboys shown in a variety of frontier past-times. The machine-printing causes color bleed throughout which is more apparent in the landscape scenes, which softens the images creating a nice contrast to the strict confines of the coffer-like framework which is printed in a strong 3-dimensional appearance. The landscape views appear more to be pictures or illustrations as viewed in a picture frame, as opposed to viewing a landscape through an open window.",
