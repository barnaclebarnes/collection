    "description": "Shiny, flat black interlacing yarns consisting of two warp yarns and one weft woven from three different axes.",
    "justification": "This triaxial fabric, produced and manufactured by Sakase Adtech Co., Ltd. in 2002, is an example of a technical textile: a textile that has been specially engineered for high performance use in a specific area of industry. \n \nThe fabric is made of triaxially-woven carbon fiber. It consists of two shiny, flat, black interlacing warps and one weft woven from three different axes. The strength of the triaxial weave is combined with the extraordinary strength and nearly weightless quality of the carbon fiber, which enables endless possibilities for use in many areas of industry. The structure of the textile allows it to be shaped and molded easily because it has three different axes. This all but eliminates the problems of stress in plain weave textiles because any bending or shaping of the textile is counter to the direction of the weave. \nSome of the most common uses for triaxially-woven carbon fiber have been for knee braces, skis, and fishing rods. Of course, other yarns can be used with the triaxial weave; perhaps the most commercially-successful use of the triaxial weave has been in running shoes. With the need for maximum flexibility and durability in sports, this unique structure has proven invaluable.\nThe technology for triaxial weaving was actually invented centuries ago during the Nara period (710\u2013794 AD). It was rediscovered by NASA in the 1960s for use in aeronautics. As an example of transfer technology or \u201cadaptive reuse,\u201d the technology (including the looms) was bought by Sakase and retooled for a wider consumer market. It is an exemplary textile that demonstrates how old technology is rediscovered and reinterpreted according to the needs of the present day.\nThis work, along with the other Japanese textiles in the museum\u2019s collection, begins to establish a strong core collection of contemporary textiles, an area specifically targeted for acquisition. These examples reflect some of the best textiles made during the late 20th and early 21st century, the study of which will add to an underst",
