    "justification": "Iridescent Satin, designed in 1994 by Koichi Yoshimura, combines polyester monofilament with a cotton weft, and through a piece dyeing process in which the blue dye adheres only to the monofilament, Yoshimura is able to achieve an intense blue highlight. His knowledge of the scientific properties of individual yarns combined with his understanding of the dyeing process has transformed a relatively plain textile into a shimmering lighted surface. \nYoshimura is a second generation textile designer educated at Kobe University. His company, S.Yoshimura, located in Fukui, an important textile manufacturing center in Japan, specializes in polyester and its combination with other yarns to create unusual effects. In addition to his own designs, he has worked with fashion designers Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto, and Donna Karan.\nThis work, together with the six other Japanese textiles proposed for acquisition, will begin to establish a strong core of contemporary textiles, an area specifically targeted for acquisition. They reflect some of the best textiles made during the late 20th century. Studying these textiles will add to an understanding of not only current Japanese technology but also of long-standing textile traditions in Japan.",
