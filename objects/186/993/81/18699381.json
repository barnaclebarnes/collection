Printed in \"split-fountain\" which produces color transitions from red at top left, through orange, yellow to green, blue, lavender and violet at bottom right corner. The date is printed in black at top center.",
    "justification": "This poster is by Max Bill, a Swiss painter, sculptor, and designer who is one of the seminal figures in 20th-century Swiss graphic design and typography. Bill is most famous for his graphic interpretation of Bauhaus and constructivist ideals. His designs from the mid-1930s for the Zurich Kunstgewerbemuseum show his application of geometric forms and an ordered compositional layout directly inspired by the graphic and typographical innovations of Herbert Bayer, his mentor at the Bauhaus from 1927 to 1929. \nBill studied at the Zurich Kunstgewerbeschule from 1924 to 1927 and at the Bauhaus in Dessau from 1927 to 1929. Bill returned to Zurich in 1929, where he became instrumental in the development of the constructivist ideal in Swiss graphic design. He was the co founder and director of the Ulm School of Arts and Crafts (1931\u201356), an institution dedicated \u201cto improve the quality, form and functionality of commodities made in Germany.\u201d[1] Bill was also the head architect of the Building and Design Sectors for the Swiss National Exhibit in Lausanne (1961\u201364) and was a professor at the State School for Fine Arts in Hamburg in 1967.\nThis poster, designed in 1931 for a series of concerts at the Stadtheater in Basel, reveals a unique episode in Bill\u2019s graphic design and typographical career. Rather than the expected architectonic formal structure of his best known graphic designs, Bill adopted a modified Dada aesthetic appropriate for promoting a series of three performances featuring the music of Eric Satie with stage designs by Francis Picabia and Jean Cocteau. The juxtaposition of fonts, borders, and bright color embodies the startling and unconventional activity that characterizes these three plays. This poster exists in several states, as the date\u2014in this example, April 19, 1931\u2014was updated to advertise each performance. \nThe museum has a fine selection of Swiss posters designed by Josef M\u00fcller-Brockmann, Armin Hoffmann, and Wolfgang Weingart. Numerous American graphic designers, including April Greiman and Dan Friedman, who were strongly influenced by The New Typography characteristic of Swiss design in the 1950s and 1960s are also represented. The museum has earmarked Bill as one of the key designers whose work should be documented in the graphic design collection. This poster would be the first by Max Bill and also the first Swiss graphic design from the era before World War II. \n[1] Deed of donation, 1953.",
    "gallery_text": "Swiss artist-designer Max Bill\u2019s 1930 poster advertising a Dada ballet performance, developed shortly after he left the Bauhaus design school, embodies the transforming art and design styles in Europe and in Bill\u2019s personal oeuvre. The design is an unusual mix of Bauhaus\u2014which espoused \u201cform follows function\u201d and order\u2014and Dada\u2014a Swiss movement that defied convention, embracing chaos and disorder. The multicolored, varied fonts and overlapping text refer to the ballet\u2019s spirit, but are grounded on two planes, assisting legibility. Bill would later become known for his reductive, functional typography, but this poster shows a brief embrace of organized visual chaos. It exists in at least two other forms: a vertical poster with the same information plus the dancers\u2019 first names and a \u201cstatement of aesthetics\u201d in a small block of text on the lower left, and another horizontal poster that includes the text block but not the dance \u201cParade,\u201d and lists a date of April 24, rather than April 19.",
    "label_text": "The diagonal text blocks in this poster disrupt the mechanical grid of letterpress, a traditional printing method in which modular elements are locked together in rectangular forms for printing. Inspired by Dada typography, Bill\u2019s poster mixes various display types with ornamental rules, employing existing printing components in a dynamic way. Two passes of ink overlap in Bill\u2019s poster: a black layer plus a rainbow of colors combined directly in the printing process.",
