    "description": "Within a black frame, narrower on the left and right than on top and bottom, the design features a hand emerging from a shirt cuff at the top left. The view is palm downward; a v is formed by the thumb and the remaining four fingers, which are stretched out and close together. The reproduction is in a dense black medium with white highlights. Below the thumb, Set\/ Construction, imprinted in bold non-serif style type, is followed underneath by four lines of smaller type, in turn followed by eight lines of one or two words each. The Set Shop logo, a red stencil-style S on a white background, rimmed by a red circular band on which the company name, address and telephone number are imprinted, is placed to the right. Beginning on the top right of the page and extending to just below the center, twenty parallel black bands jutting out from the right-hand frame display Set Shop products in white uppercase type. The fingers of the hand touch the left edge of the center section of bands. Further information about Set Shop services, headed in bold black type, Call us to quote your next job, and ending several lines later with the company telephone number imprinted in bold red, occupies the space between the bottom curve of the logo and the lower edge of the page.",
