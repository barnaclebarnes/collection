A logo centered at the top of the page features a silhouetted steer in the center, placed between the letter M on top and the letter C on bottom, both surrounded by a pinpoint dot on each side; the whole is enclosed within a double-bordered diamond shape. Aligned with the logo, just above the bottom edge, Midnight\/ Cowboy, imprinted in sans serif style capitals, is followed underneath by three lines of the address and telephone number and a final line, A Division of Marabbedan, Inc.\n\n1993-151-237b - Envelope - In the top left hand corner, Midnight Cowboy, underscored by a thin line, is imprinted in the same font as on the letterhead.
