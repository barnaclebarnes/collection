    "description": "Front cover - On a background of glossy white cardboard, the design features a fanciful architectural rendering of the client's project against a background of New York skyline-and-sunset. Pale tones of reds and blues predominate and an angular, gate-like shape in a black checkerboard pattern, suggestive of windowed apartment construction, is superimposed in the right half. Jutting out of the square on the lower left are three parallel wavy lines. In the upper right-hand corner, the logo is imprinted, composed of turquoise-colored bars, one vertical, and at right angles, one horizontal, extending from the lower left, and a second, directly underneath the vertical, extending to the right; the horizontals are imprinted The Perry\/Apartments and the vertical, + West, all in upper case sans serif type. The wavy line motif, repeated underneath in a smaller, black version, completes the logo.\n\nInside front cover - A full page version of the cover design in black outline is imprinted on a matte turquoise background. \n\nPage 1, facing - The logo is repeated in the left half. The design format followed throughout the sixteen-page brochure is established on the right: initial phrases of paragraphs are highlighted by bars in yellow or blue; and interspersed on succeeding pages, architectural renderings in red and blue tones, accompanied by a few photographic reproductions, depict interior and exterior features of the project and its environs. Page numbers, imprinted in the lower left and right-hand corners, are backed by the wavy line motif in red. \n\nThe inside back cover consists of a glossy turquoise cardboard flap, extending about three quarters of the way across from the right edge. Marketing information is imprinted in white in widely separated paragraphs. Brochure Design\/ M&Co, Written by\/ Danny Abelson, and Architectural Renderings:\/ Albert Taylor Hennings are imprinted in black just above the bottom edge. The flap reverses to a yellow matte surface, which continues on the inside back page; there, blue lines, as on a legal paper pad, are imprinted from the left edge part of the way across. Six architectural renderings of room plans, in black and white on translucent paper, are inserted in the back flap.\n\nBack cover - On the same glossy white surface of the front cover, the design, featuring a columnar form, curved at the top and centered, is comprised of a red and white windowpane-patterned rectangle superimposed on a turquoise background; a diagonal yellow strip, extending from the lower edge of the pane, is cut off by an apricot-colored rectangle ending at the lower edge.",
