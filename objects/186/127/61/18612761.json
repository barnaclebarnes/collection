    "description": "A group of three children in the center of a grassy lawn with a large shadow of a swastika looming over them. One of the boy stands while holding a toy plane while another in a paper hat holds up an  American flag. A girl sits in front of them, holding a doll. In the lower margin is the text, \"Don't Let That Shadow Touch Them \/ Buy WAR BONDS.\"",

It was distributed by the U.S. Department of Treasury and printed by the U.S. Government Printing Office.",

He is the point-of-view character in the scene, and we are expected to identify with his situation. Like him, we must \u201cgrow up\u201d and take responsibility for the more naive people around us. As war propaganda, the poster promotes US involvement in World War II, which many citizens did not support.",
