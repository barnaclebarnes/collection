    "justification": "Flectron, manufactured by Laird Technologies, is a flexible, lightweight, and highly conductive technical textile used in the building industry. Its non-woven copper-coated polyester structure makes it ideal for preventing electromagnetic interference in areas which need to be shielded, such as conference rooms, offices, and MRI rooms. Flectron is meant to be used and installed like wallpaper, although it can be covered by other types of wall finishing material such as sheetrock or wood paneling. It can also be directly painted over. The textile has a highly-engineered function and technical performance, and the overall intention of concealment belies its ultimate aesthetic beauty as a fabric. \nFlectron will be included in the upcoming 2005 exhibition, Extreme Textiles: Designing for High Performance. In preparation for the exhibition it is important to acquire a variety of technical textiles for the collection; they are extremely important as design artifacts and often relate to the historical textiles in our collection with regards to technique.",
