    "justification": "This plate, a product of the Royal Copenhagen factory, has a mark indicating it was produced sometime after 1889. The surface is marked \u201cStelling\u2019s Porcelaensfarver\u201d in the center, surrounded by samples of glazes in various colors brushed on in small wedge shapes around the rim and the circular well. Each color has its corresponding code number and could have served as a guide for prospective clients to select colors or as a guide for porcelain painters at the factory.\nThis plate is an example of the \u201csampling\u201d format. This format was widely used by manufacturers to assist consumers in choosing the right combination of color, design, and materials, for products ranging from textiles to dinner plates. These products have become stylistic indicators of the time in terms of the choices of color and design. They also are beautiful artifacts in the arrangement of visual information on either the page of a sample book or the rim of a plate.\nSample plates are relatively rare and greatly enrich the museum\u2019s documentary holdings related to ceramics design, technology, and marketing.",
