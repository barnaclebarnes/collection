Design consists of numerous overlayed abstract shapes which appear to form roughly four distinct forms. On left is thick vertical rectangle comprised of thin black lines. In center, a black razor-like parallelogram formed by several horizontal and vertical black bars. Horizontal bars are on a diagonal. In upper portion of black form are three rows of four sideways \"V\" shapes. At lower right side of design, three smaller black parallelograms form a larger razor-like parallelogram. Behind the three black forms is a larger orange rectangle that ends, at top, with a diagonal. Orange form is comrpised of, from left to right, a thick vertical orange bar, a series of four thinner vertical bars, and a vertical grid of orange cells.",
