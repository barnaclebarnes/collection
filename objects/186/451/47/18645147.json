He is the old singing fellow\/In my brain, who skips or digs to sow salt.\/And there is not peace or pause for me even before\/The reiteration which convinces truth of truthfulness.\/\u2018To love one\u2019s neighbor\u2019 fronts \u2018to live in righteousness,\u2019\/And they slash like soldiers of a bloody peace.\/For they pray for self and then for the other\u2019s good,\/Both counting beads of abnegation:\/\u2018I love you as I love myself.\u2019 \u2018I live in righteousness,\/I am sincere, nor have I other gods before Him.\u2019\/This gives me pause, starts me from sleep in the dawn\/Begins to pound my head between stones big as fists,\/And sets my feet in a path to be hewn out.\/I hear my neighbor who is just whisper out,\/22.",

    "description": "Page 22-23. Left: text. Right: Abstract design in black, orange, and white. Design is broken into roughly two halves. Left side consists of horizontal row of three identical shape clusters. Each cluster consists of from left to right: thick vertical black bar topped with quarter circle and ending with triangle; vertical row of small black half circles above thin black bar; a thin bar consisting of thin black lines over a thin orange bar. Each shape cluster is slightly longer at the bottom, creating a diagonal of roughly 45 degrees. Right side of design consists of, on left, thick black vertical bar with two triangles at top, and one triangle at bottom. To right of bar are two shape clusters which are 180-degree mirror images of shape clusters on left except that half-circles remain on top and triangles on bottom. These three forms are also staggered diagonally to form a 45-degree angle. The three forms are superimposed over  vertical orange rectangle that fillsroughly 1\/4 of design at upper right.",
