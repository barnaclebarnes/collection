    "description": "Centered near the top of the page, within an oval, there is a photographic image of mountains, vegetation and sky, which shows clouds with sun shining through. Between this image and the top edge of the page, and following the oval's curve, is the phrase: the right to live, the right to die, with an ideogram separating the two halves of the message. A legal form, headed New York Living Will, is reproduced, occupying most of the page; it begins just below the image and ends just above an additional phrase in the message, the right to choose, which echos the curved form of the phrase above. Completing the message, \"from over 20 entrees\" is imprinted below this last line. The names of the two sponsoring restaurants and the sponsoring organization, as well as additional information, appear at the bottom. The whole is superimposed on a gray sky and clouds.",
