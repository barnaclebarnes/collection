    "description": "1993-151-32a, Box interior - Beginning at the top of the box lid and continuing almost to the bottom of the box's back section, a quotation from Kurt Vonnegut's novel, \"Slaughterhouse Five,\" is imprinted in white sans-serif type. The source of the quotation appears on one line at the end.\n\n1993-151-32b, Box liner - Wrapped around the left side and lower back interior sections, and creased at their intersection, is an orange Day-Glo-type cardboard \ninsert. Imprinting on the side section is parallel to the left edge (the viewer turns the object to read): just next to the left edge, confused? in a hand-drawn-styled bold lower case font; directly underneath, centered, an arrow, pointing downward; just before the crease, in the same style font, but fine, So are we. That's why we're providing this. A curved arrow points in the direction of the narrative imprinted on the back section, headed, in capitals, UR-Guide, Mapping Key and Semiotic Analysis\/ of Your Equal-Religious-Opportunity, 100% Recyclable X-Gift. Line illustrations of the box contents, accompanied by brief descriptions, comprise the remainder of the design.\n\n1993-151-32c, Flower squirter - A ruffle-edged fabric flower, with petals shading from bright to pale blue and stamens of brown plastic, is attached to a squirter. The red tip at one end of the tubing, inserted in the center of the flower, becomes the pistil; at the other end is a red bulb, which when squeezed, spurts water. \n\n1993-151-32d, Toilet water - A plastic bottle with a black stopper contains water tinted a pale orange. A white label, pasted inside, in imprinted across the center in sans-serif black capitals, Optimism, followed by M&Co in lower case, near the bottom edge.\n\n1993-151-32e, Soap - A cake of soap, beige and curve-edged, like the case containing it, is incised in the center, Truth, in capitals.\n\n1993-151-32f, Soap case - A silver-colored metallic case, with curved edges like those of the soap within, is imprinted across the center Basta Nostalgia, in white sans-serif cepitals. M&Co 1991 appears, centered, just above the bottom edge of the case.\n\n1993-151-32g, Dirt pillow - A plastic bag of soil serves to protect the box contents from damage during shipment.\n\n1993-151-32h, Filler - Beige, crinkled paper filler is placed between and around the objects.\n\n1993-151-32i, Gift card - Of the same material as the box liner, the card is imprinted just below the top edge Make it new. Cheers from M&Co.",
