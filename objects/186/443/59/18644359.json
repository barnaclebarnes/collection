    "description": "The photograph, situated in a fashion office\/ workroom, features a head-to-hip view, occupying the full vertical space to the right of center, of a model with black hair in a gamine style, wearing a strapless dress that shows some cleavage, in a shimmering blue-gray fabric, with a full, gathered skirt, and a wide red belt at the waist. Her arms are bent and her fingers are clasped under her chin; her head is turned slightly to her left and her eyes are cast downward, emphasizing her heavy black eyelashes and eyebrows. The designer, Isaac Mizrahi, whose bent head and downcast eyes focus on adjusting the back of the dress, stands behind the model; the top of his head is at the level of her ear, the left side of his face is partly obscured by her upper body, and the right shoulder and arm are partly visible. A pair of shoes, perhaps Mr. Mizrahi's, is on the floor immediately to the left, while \nfurther back, two seated figures at a table and an assortment of photographs, papers and boxes are visible. The whole is set within a white border. On bottom, right of center, the designer's logo is imprinted and in the bottom left-hand corner, Fashions of the Times appears.",
