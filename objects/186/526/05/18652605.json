    "gallery_text": "The Visiting Artists Jacquard Project at the Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science (1993\u201395) paired 10 artists with student technicians and the latest digital jacquard technology: a Somet Jacquard System with a Staubli head. The intent was to stretch the students\u2019 understanding of the capabilities of the new technology through the artists\u2019 experimentations, each driven by different aesthetic concerns. \nIn building his fiber constructions, artist Lewis Knauss often uses repetition of action to capture the passage of time intrinsic in landscape. For this digital work, Knauss began by drawing a line directly on the computer screen, drawing variations, and working with scale. He then began experimenting with the repeat. While there were no limits to the vertical length of the design, the horizontal repeat was only 14 inches. When he realized that the line would \u201cwrap\u201d when it hit the edge of the repeat, he began to to exploit this limitation. The original lines multiplied in number along the length, so that the cloth shifts from nearly all white at one end to nearly all black at the other. While Cloned Line is very technical, like Knauss\u2019s handmade constructions, it is a meditation on line as landscape\u2014the mark of the rake or the plough.",
