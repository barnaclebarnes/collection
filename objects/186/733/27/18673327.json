Since energy conservation is \/ an important consideration in construction. \/\n2nd paragraph: Today, the conservation features incor- \/ porated in the building will result in a [sic] \/ significantly reduced energy consumption. \/ For one thing, the building's insulated \/ extreior walls and double glazed, reflec- \/ tive windows will reduce the demands \/ on the air conditioning system and will \/ also tend to reduce energy usage \/ of the heating system in winter. It is \/ estimated that only14 percent of solar \/ radiation will be transmitted as against \/ 90 percent by conventional glass, and \/ this will markedly decrease the solar \/ heat entering the building.\n3rd paragraph: The portion of the building that Citicorp \/ will occupy will feature newly developed \/ lighting fixtures that will reduce the \/ amount of energy required for illumination. \/ These fixtures will be single tube fluores- \/ cents with reflectors that will transmit a \/ higher percentage of light than is normal \/ from a standard fluorescent fixture.\n4th paragraph: In addition, Citicorp Center will use a spe- \/ cial system of air filters which will permit \/ the reuse of air generated by the heating \/ and cooling units. This will reduce the \/ intake of outside air, diminishing the need \/ to cool or heat new air coming into the \/ building. \/ Moreover, the air inside the build- \/ ing will be cleaner because it will be sub- \/ stantially free of pollutants.",
