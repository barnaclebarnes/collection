    "gallery_text": "Austrian designer Michael Powolny, who trained as a ceramicist, was perhaps best known for his sculptures of putti and animals. However, for utilitarian wares\u2014in ceramics as well as in glass\u2014he also employed formal, abstract designs. In 1913, Powolny designed seven pieces of glass, manufactured by The Bohemian factory L\u00f6tz Witwe, marking an important collaboration between modern Viennese designers and Bohemian glassmakers that would also include Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte cofounder Josef Hoffmann. The linear, two-dimensional decoration of these pieces, as seen on this bowl, reflects the avant-garde Viennese style of functional, unornamented design. These design ideals were promoted by the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, with whom he began collaborating for ceramics production in 1907. The L\u00f6tz pieces were shown in the 1914 exhibition in Cologne held by the Deutscher Werkbund, an association of influential craftsmen. The simple motif proved successful at the exhibition and became the L\u00f6tz factory\u2019s most-used design, though with varying colors and on a range of vessel forms, until the 1920s.",
