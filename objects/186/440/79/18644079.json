    "description": "1993-151-147a - Folder - When the folder is closed, the navy blue front flap, extending from the left, overlaps the smaller black right-hand flap, allowing a narrow column of black to show. Within parentheses, The Hotel Mercer is imprinted on the folder in small white capitals, sans serif style, as follows: The Hotel, centered top to bottom, near the right edge of the blue flap; underneath, on the black flap, abutting the left edge and continuing on the same line as Hotel, Mercer. The center section, or back, continues in black. When the folder is opened, the left-hand flap (the inside of the blue cover) and the center section (the inside of the black back) are chartreuse, as is the flap which folds up from the bottom. Three lines of type, consisting of address and telephone information, are centered on the outside of the bottom flap. Next to the center section, on the purple inside flap (the reverse of the front cover black) and on the same line as The Hotel Mercer, in Soho) is imprinted.\n\nThe typography style of the folder, small sans-serif capitals, continues in the contents. The Mercer is always in parentheses and is larger and darker.   \n\n1993-151-147b - Letterhead - On white bond, hotel name, address and telephone numbers are imprinted on one line across, approximately one and a half inches from the top.\n\n1993-151-147c - Label - The self-stick label is imprinted with the hotel name and address on one line across, about one-half inch from the top edge.\n\n1993-151-147d - Business card - The hotel name and address are imprinted across, close to the top edge. Underneath, to the right, Serge Becker, in darker capitals, is imprinted, followed by two lines of telephone and fax numbers.",
