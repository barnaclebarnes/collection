A gentelman in high hat points to a botanical book showing a drawing of the coffee plant.  A man, seated at a table, appears to be holding a coffee bean pod in his right hand.  To his left, a woman is pouring coffee into a cup held by a young boy.  A woman, seen through the doorway (rear left) is grinding coffee beans.  Another woman, seen outdoors (rear right) appears to be working at a bean roasting apparatus.",
