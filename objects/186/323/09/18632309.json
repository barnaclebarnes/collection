A man in right foreground is holding a pineapple in his left hand while offering a taste of the fruit in his right hand to two small girls.  Another man at center points to a wall thermometer to verify the ideal room temperature to ripen pineapples.  A watering can in the left foreground, leans on a table which holds potted pineapples.  Snakes hang from rafter supports in the middle ground.  A map showing Mexico and Brazil is mounted on the rear wall. Light streams through the multi-paned window at right.",
