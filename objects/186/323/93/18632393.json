A gardener talks with a young woman while pointing to two children trying to reach the pears on tree limbs hanging outside the gate.  He appears to be telling her to stop them from stealing his pears.  A tall ladder with basket (right foreground) leans against a tree.  A rake and pear-filled basket (left foreground) lie on a dirt path.",
