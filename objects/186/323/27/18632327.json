Two men are carrying up the stairs large tiered cakes; one in the form of a windmill, the other in the form of a planted jardiniere.  A third cake in the form of a medieval chapel including sculptural niches, has fallen to the floor, center middleground.  Two children, in the left foreground; one picks up the pieces, the other points his finger in the direction of a horrified man.  This man and a woman, rear center, express their dismay.  Through a doorway, rear center, people are seated at a table.",
