    "description": "Scene in a cheese shop showing the proprietress, right, standing in front of a counter.  She lifts a glass dome uncovering a piece of cheese which she prepares to cut with a knife that is attached to her apron by a chain.  She appears to have caught two children, to the left, stealing bread.  Behind the counter are three shelves holding wheels or balls of cheese.  On the counter, behind the woman, is a scale.  A cat, left middleground, is eating some cheese; a bird in a cage is suspended from above.  In the left rear, a view of an outside market with clients crowded under umbrella-covered stalls.",
