    "gallery_text": "Letter writing was considered a genteel pursuit in the eighteenth century. Writing sets and related accoutrements became a material reflection of one\u2019s literacy and social status. Any fashionable desk or dressing table would be host to a complex array of equipment, including paper, quills, ink, sealing wax and a pounce pot. Pounce pots contained a powdered substance, usually gum sandarac, which was sprinkled on paper to prevent ink from bleeding across the page while writing. The growing consumer market for stationary supplies was fueled by a global trade of raw materials. Gum sandarac, often shortened to \u2018sand\u2019, was exported from Morocco; writing ink required oak galls from Syria and gum Arabic from Sudan. \n \nMeissen produced several different barrel-shaped pounce pots. The low relief pattern of flowering branches seen on this version was typical of molded decoration popular in the mid-eighteenth century. The sculptural floral handle, and painted fauna gratified contemporary interest in the natural world.",
