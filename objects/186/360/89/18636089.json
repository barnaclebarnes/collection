The column is surmounted by an elongated bell-shaped form, which in turn supports a smaller spherical form, upon which rests a conical form.  Left: Section of a brown colored cornice displayed at a leftward sloping angle.  The top band of the cornice is punctuated with silver roundels and the lower cornice is cut out with cusped arches, which are interspersed with small gold rimmed roundels.  The arches are edged with gold coloring.  Two thin, green-black lines extend vertically from the cornice, indicating the wall below.",
