    "description": "Design for painted decorations.  The upper band of decoration consists of swags of red, white and blue that flower into trefoil ornaments at the juncture points between the swags.  A red dot is drawn between each slumping part of the swag.  Below is a series of four roundels with abstracted foliate designs in red and blue.  Between the closely placed roundels are green palmette forms that flourish at either end of the roundels.  Below this is a band of upward swags, similar in design to those above.  At the lower portion of the page is a repeating design of tripartite foliate flourishes, from which delicate scrolling designs emerge.  Below is a line of green, broadly undulating scrolls and two broadly arching parallel red lines.  Below this, small red dots mark the terminating points of the arches.  Three thin green lines run vertically throughout the design.",
