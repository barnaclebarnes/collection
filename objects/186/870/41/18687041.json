Sneaker sole (below), segmented in globular compartments, in red, black, and turqoise.",
    "justification": "Nike\u2019s campaign for the Air Jordan line of sneakers, executed by Tinker Hatfield in collaboration with Michael Jordan, is an excellent example of branding: creating a brand image that sums up a product mythology. With the 13 different Air Jordan models that Hatfield created from 1981 through 1998, he pioneered a sneaker design language that catapulted the Nike\/Jordan line from an ordinary product to a superbrand. The fluid, bulging, black and red honeycomb ornament of the Air Jordan XIII model plays on the image of Michael Jordan\u2019s bulging muscles in his red Chicago Bull\u2019s uniform. \nWhile Cooper-Hewitt does not collect fashion or shoe design, we do collect drawings for corporate graphic design and logos. This is the most visually powerful example of the Nike drawings exhibited in the museum\u2019s National Design Triennial in 2000. The Air Jordan XIII was part of a trendsetting product campaign and reflects the influence of Michael Jordan on American consumer culture.",
    "gallery_text": "The lumpy sole of this sneaker design highlights its airbag cushioning, then a cutting-edge technology. Hatfield cleverly combines this form with black and red honeycomb ornament, evoking the contours of Jordan\u2019s muscles in his red Chicago Bulls uniform.",
