    "description": "Set design for the film Titus Andonicus (by William Shakespeare),  adapted and directed by Julie Taymor.  For this setting, Ferretti was inspired by the urban stage of the Palazzo della Civita del Lavoro in Rome - a multi-storied building of arcaded walls built by Benito Mussolini as a fascist imitation of grand ancient Roman architecture.  He dressed the building with heraldic banners, accented by the giant statue of a rearing horse.  The rest of the set (rendered in rust-red, burnt-ocher, and smokey black)  suggests the surreal space of a Giorgio de Chirico painting. Diagonal perspective.  Six story Palazzo (in white) raised on platform with steps on left.  Pair of horses statutes at each end of platform.  Three vertical banners (height of building) at far left.  Series of monumental painting and vertical banner from center to far right.  Four high pedestal for torches (in white) aligned to center of Palazzo.  Mass of people gathered in front.",
