    "gallery_text": "Richard Arbib began his industrial design career as a car stylist in the late 1930s under Harley Earl. After opening his own design studio in New York in 1939, he designed products from ocean liners to dirigibles to refrigerators to wristwatches\u2014for US government agencies and commercial manufacturers\u2014for more than half a century. One of Arbib\u2019s most innovative and well-known designs is the Princess vacuum for Eureka, the first suitcase-shaped vacuum cleaner. Introduced in the 1950s, the Princess was intended to be lightweight and easy to carry around the house. After setting record sales for Eureka, it was produced in different varieties and widely copied by other companies. This presentation drawing shows a sleeker, more compact suitcase-shaped vacuum than the original. While still a student, Arbib termed his design style \u201cplastonic\u201d for its lack of corners or sharp angles. He believed the term \u201cstreamlining,\u201d which became popular with the rise of the industrial design profession in the 1930s, should not be applied to immobile objects. The futuristic shapes were characteristic of Arbib\u2019s design throughout his career, as were the carefully rendered and colored presentation drawings, which helped raise the level of this preliminary work across the profession.",
