    "justification": "The husband and wife team of Tod Williams and Billie Tsien ranks among the most successful American architectural firms working today. Over the course of their practice, this firm has produced renowned structures for numerous institutions and private clients. Their institutional projects include buildings for Princeton University, Clark University, University of Virginia, the Phoenix Art Museum, and the Cranbrook Educational Community. In addition, they design one or two residences per year, among the most well-known of which are the Speyer townhouse in Manhattan and the Rivkind house in East Hampton, New York, which was the recipient of an AIA award.\nThe Tod Williams Billie Tsien and Associates project for the American Folk Art Museum in New York City was featured in the 2000 National Design Museum Triennial. Located on a slender plot on West 53rd Street, adjacent to property owned by MoMA, the eight-level building totals 30,000 square feet. The American Folk Art Museum site is excee",
    "gallery_text": "This drawing features two views of the facade of the American Folk Art Museum (AFAM). Husband-and-wife design team Tod Williams and Billie Tsien had to accommodate for the narrow, forty-foot-wide site by making a powerful exterior statement in form and materials. They have likened the three-part faceted facade to an abstracted open hand, a welcoming symbol referencing the museum\u2019s collections of hand-wrought objects. The smaller image on the left, conveying a three-quarter sidewalk perspective, shows how the facade would appear from the street, inviting in passersby. The small, quickly sketched shading on both views references the way the material, Tombasil, an alloyed bronze cast at an art foundry, would catch and reflect light at various angles throughout the day. The architects wanted their work to elicit emotion, and the wide praise the finished design received did just that. In December 2001, the same month the building opened, Herbert Muschamp of the New York Times proclaimed the facade to be \u201calready a Midtown icon.\u201d Unfortunately for the design, AFAM sold the building to its neighbor, the Museum of Modern Art, in 2011 during a financial crisis. Against much public resistance, MoMA decided to tear down the building and transport the facade to storage.",
