    "justification": "The husband and wife team of Tod Williams and Billie Tsien ranks among the most successful American architectural firms working today. Over the course of their practice, this firm has produced renowned structures for numerous institutions and private clients. Their institutional projects include buildings for Princeton University, Clark University, University of Virginia, the Phoenix Art Museum, and the Cranbrook Educational Community. In addition, they design one or two residences per year, among the most well-known of which are the Speyer townhouse in Manhattan and the Rivkind house in East Hampton, New York, which was the recipient of an AIA award.\nThe Tod Williams Billie Tsien and Associates project for the American Folk Art Museum in New York City was featured in the 2000 National Design Museum Triennial. Located on a slender plot on West 53rd Street, adjacent to property owned by MoMA, the eight-level building totals 30,000 square feet. The American Folk Art Museum site is excee",
    "gallery_text": "The American Folk Art Museum (AFAM) opened in December 2001 to wide critical acclaim. This collage perspective gives an abstract view of the building\u2019s West 53rd Street home, demonstrating how the townhouse-size museum would compare to against its midtown New York neighbors, most notably the iconic Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), which surrounds the building on three sides. Husband-and-wife architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien embrace an earthy, tactile, and emotional modernism. That idea is heightened here by the juxtaposition of the hand-drawn AFAM against photographs from the midtown streetscape. Each part of the faceted facade would be made of Tombasil, an alloyed bronze that would catch and reflect light in different ways throughout the day, represented here by three shades of gray and energetic pencil lines radiating off the building. Williams and Tsien typically use models, rather than drawings, in their design process, so this collage\u2014an artwork in its own right\u2014is somewhat rare in their oeuvre. AFAM sold the building to MoMA, in 2011 during a financial crisis. Although neighbors, critics, collectors, and architects\u2014including New York\u2019s Architectural League\u2014passionately fought to keep the building intact, it will be torn down to make room for MoMA's expansion.",
