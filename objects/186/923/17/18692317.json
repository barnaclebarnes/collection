    "justification": "The husband and wife team of Tod Williams and Billie Tsien ranks among the most successful American architectural firms working today. Over the course of their practice, this firm has produced renowned structures for numerous institutions and private clients. Their institutional projects include buildings for Princeton University, Clark University, University of Virginia, the Phoenix Art Museum, and the Cranbrook Educational Community. In addition, they design one or two residences per year, among the most well-known of which are the Speyer townhouse in Manhattan and the Rivkind house in East Hampton, New York, which was the recipient of an AIA award.\nThe Tod Williams Billie Tsien and Associates project for the American Folk Art Museum in New York City was featured in the 2000 National Design Museum Triennial. Located on a slender plot on West 53rd Street, adjacent to property owned by MoMA, the eight-level building totals 30,000 square feet. The American Folk Art Museum site is exceedingly narrow\u2014only 40 feet\u2014so the architects were compelled to devise a fa\u00e7ade that was powerful and monumental enough to make an independent statement. \nThis elevation perspective, featured as a photo blow-up in the Triennial exhibition, is a rough concept sketch that explores the building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade and sculptural form as seen from the MoMA entrance. The large, smooth planes of the fa\u00e7ade are roughly shaped like a cupped hand, which permits the building more mass on the street than if the fa\u00e7ade were flat. Tod Williams Billie Tsien use drawings sparingly in their design process. Yet this drawing\u2014even when isolated from the range of models that also characterize their design process\u2014shows, in microcosm, a key stage of the building\u2019s design development. \nThis drawing is one of five related drawings by Tod Williams Billie Tsien proposed for acquisition. These drawings would supplement Cooper-Hewitt\u2019s collection of designs for museum projects by Richard Meier (Getty, Barcelona Contemporary Art Museum, Columbus Athenaeum). The drawings also create a neat closure to the story of New York 20th-century architecture that was initiated by the iconic Maximum Mass studies of Hugh Ferriss, also held by the museum.  \nJanuary 31, 2001",
