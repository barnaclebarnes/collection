    "gallery_text": "Paul Rand was a leading twentieth-century modernist graphic designer whose six-decade career left a lasting impact on graphic design, branding, and commercial art. Though sometimes whimsical, Rand\u2019s ultimate focus was clarity in design. After revamping IBM's logo and corporate identity in the 1950s, he was asked to do the same for Westinghouse Electric Company. His first task was to redesign the company's visually outdated turn-of-the-century logo; his 1960 \"W\" trade mark, seen right center of this flat packaging, is still in use today. Aware of the importance of brand recognition, he retained the circle and underscore from earlier iterations, preferring to revamp rather than completely redesign a logo. Rand\u2019s version is suggestive of a circuit board, connecting the logo's form to the company\u2019s purpose. A year later he developed the Westinghouse Gothic typeface to be used on signs, packaging, advertising, and other corporate ephemera. In 1968, upon the success of his logo and other design consultancy work for Westinghouse, Rand redesigned the Lamp Division's packaging. He eliminated unnecessary graphics, using a light bulb to make the package\u2019s contents apparent, and enlarged the type size that relayed the bulb wattage and hours, previously nearly illegible.",
    "label_text": "Rand\u2019s corporate identity for Westinghouse, introduced in 1960, features a stylized letter W that also resembles an electrical outlet. Similar in language to George Nelson\u2019s 1949 Ball clock and the textile designs of Ray Eames, Westinghouse\u2019s funky, mid-century logo remains in use today. Rand\u2019s light bulb packaging emphasizes the wattage and shape of the bulb, information a consumer would be searching for.",
