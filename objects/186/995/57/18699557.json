    "description": "Die-cut shapes on a walnut grain adhesive vinyl.  The cutouts include a cuckoo clock, souvenir spoons in a rack, lantern and oars for canoe.  The paper is meant to evoke a cabin-like feeling where ever it is installed.  The paper can be installed over an existing wallpaper, allowing the old paper to show through the cutout designs. This allows the past to continue in the present.",
    "justification": "Memory Wallpaper is a self-adhesive vinyl wallcovering designed by Cynthia Hathaway. The design was created as a proposal submitted to a \u201ccabin-themed\u201d exhibition organized by Mother, a Canadian product and graphic design firm. The theme of the exhibition reflected one of Canada\u2019s most enduring icons.\nHathaway\u2019s paper has a walnut-grain pattern with cut-outs spaced throughout the roll add to the nostalgic, cabin-themed story. The shapes of the cut-outs are things that would frequently be found in log cabins, such as lanterns and oars for a canoe. When the paper is placed over old wallpaper, the cutouts through to the old paper create an automatic link between past and present. Hathaway believes it is wasteful to forget the past when we can still make use of it. The wallpaper is intended for the global \u201cdo-it-yourself\u201d market\u2014the instructions are written in 13 languages.\nWe currently have several samples of self adhesive wallcoverings in the collection. The first self-adhesive wallcovering was developed by Con-tac brand, an American company in 1954; Hathaway\u2019s design shows a new use of an old product.",
    "gallery_text": "Memory was designed for a Canadian collective called Mother, with the project being to explore the best of the cabin experience. Hathaway chose self-adhesive vinyl because it is so ubiquitous, and the woodgrain pattern reminded her of log cabins. You\u2019re seeing one of five different cut-outs that are located at various points along the roll: the others being a rack of souvenir spoons, a lantern, canoe paddles, and a Canadian Mountie. Hathaway has a strong interest in the recyclability of things and ideas and doesn\u2019t think the past should be obscured by the present. When this wallcovering is applied over an existing wallpaper, the cut-outs give the old surface an automatic link to the present and allow it to become an integral part of the design. In this image the vinyl is laid over a 1960s wallpaper.",
