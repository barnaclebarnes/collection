    "description": "Photographic reproduction of cord, very much enlarged and closely spaced. The design forms 2 inch wide vertical stripes. The very obvious fibers and shadows create a very 3-dimensional effect. Printed in pink on a white ground, this is the \"Grapeseed\" colorway.",
    "justification": "Cord #1 is part of the Touch line, designed by Petra Blaisse. Blaisse is an Amsterdam-based landscape and textile designer. In 1987, she began working as a freelance exhibition designer. In 1991, she opened her own design office, Inside Outside. Blaisse became known for her successful merging of interior and exterior architectural space. She gained international acclaim for projects across Europe and the United States, which include liquid-gold drapes for the Netherlands Dance Theatre in The Hague, curtain-as-walls for the Mick Jagger Centre near London, and pleated walls for the VIP department in the Prada store in New York City. Blaisse has also received recognition for her landscape work. \nThe Touch line of wallcoverings was produced for the contract market. They are all printed on industrial-strength vinyl. The museum does not usually collect contract wallcoverings as they tend to be very conservative. This line, however, represents a new approach for contract wallcoverings and would be a welcome addition to the collection.",
    "gallery_text": "Petra Blaisse is a person of diverse talents, having worked in fashion and publicity, landscape as well as interior design. In 1987 she began designing large-scale and quite dramatic curtains for commercial venues, often partnering with architect Rem Koolhaas. She began her own design firm called Inside Outside In 1991, and became known for her successful merging of interior and exterior spaces. Her love and knowledge of textiles led her to design the Touch collection of seven wallcoverings for Wolf-Gordon in 2003. Each of the designs is a digital image of a textile that is enlarged up to 300%. This magnification clearly shows the woven structure of the fabric along with numerous stray fibers, creating a very 3-dimensional look. Cord #1 is a greatly magnified image of vertical cords which creates a very soft and beautiful stripe pattern. Being printed in the single pink color on a white ground makes this a very subtle design that would blend in nicely with other fabrics in the room. The implied stripes are slightly irregular which give it a handmade appearance, while the very tactile design would definitely soften any room it was installed in.\n \nFounded in 1967, Wolf-Gordon is an American design company that has been commissioning top design talent for several years. The designers include Karim Rashid, Laurinda Spears and Patty Madden who have created collections of innovative and bold wallcoverings for the commercial market which includes hotels, restaurants, or any high traffic area that requires maximum durability and minimal maintenance. Their collections include a diverse group of wallcoverings and fabrics that range from vinyl and silks to grasscloth and linen, with their goal being to deliver beautiful products that are technologically advanced and easy on the environment. They accomplish this by using recycled content in the production of their wallcoverings, along with offering a reclamation program for wallcoverings no longer needed.",
