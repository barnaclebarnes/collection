    "justification": "This is one of a group of ribbons by the textile artist Laura Forest Nicholson, who is also known for her hand-woven brocaded tapestries. In these vibrant, humorous, and graphically appealing ribbons, Nicholson creates movement and exuberance through units of repetition. She interprets the ribbon as \u201cthe industrial equivalent of the tapestry: an ornate and often elaborate woven textile with its only function being to provide decoration, richness, and a sense of delight.\u201d  \n \nNicholson received her MFA at Cranbrook Academy of Art and has lectured, taught classes and workshops, and exhibited extensively in the United States. In 1996, the museum acquired Nicholson\u2019s tapestry, Everything for the Garden (1996-78-1), which is a large and playful composition depicting garden tools, vegetables, and flowers. These ribbons are designed in a similar spirit.\nNicholson\u2019s ribbons would serve as a wonderful complement to the museum\u2019s collection of ribbons and ribbon sample books, which are dated much earlier than this proposed gift. In addition, the ribbons proposed for acquisition offer a sophisticated, light-hearted and visually appealing counterpart to the elegant yet comparatively serious designs of most ribbons today.",
