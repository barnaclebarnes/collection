    "description": "1993-151-429a - The box is fabricated of natural cardboard, with an incised oval on the box top,  just to the right of the center, and arch-shaped incisions directly underneath on both sides. \n\n1993-151-429b - When the six-section accordion-fold insert is folded within the closed box, an ivory-colored oval, on the recto, imprinted M&Co (lower case italics)\/ Labs (upper case small capitals) and set on a black background, is visible through the incised oval. When removed from the box and unfolded, this section is located second from the left. The neighboring two sections in the center feature a photographic view of an industrial rigging with a tall, thin smokestack on the left. The neighboring section to the right is imprinted bottom to top in the lower half with the company name and address on three lines of ivory sans serif type; this will serve as a mailing label. A broken ivory-colored line is imprinted along the center fold of the rigging view, just past the halfway mark of the page, and continues at a right angle to the right edge of the page. The line marks the borders of a form to be scissored and mailed as directed; on the ivory-background of the verso, this ivory line, repeated in black, encloses a warranty form. In the upper half, just above the form, Waste\/ not\/ a\/ moment, is imprinted within stylized, curved branches on either side; warranty information continues underneath, followed by additional product information in the remaining space.\n\n1993-151-429c - The black flannel envelope serves as a case for the wristwatch product.",
