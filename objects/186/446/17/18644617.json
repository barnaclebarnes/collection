    "description": "The case, exterior covered in black fabric, and labelled Distinctive on the spine in hand-pasted gold paper letters, is designed to simulate a book. There is one page within imprinted with text, recto and verso. Page three, continuing the text, is mounted on cardboard which on the outside gives the appearance of actual pages, but is incised on the inside to hold a booklet, a videocassette and case, and an audiocassette case. The booklet cover, composed of a nighttime street scene with electrified signs, is bordered in red, with the top right-hand corner in yellow turned down, imprinted Advertising and Nothing But, with a crowd of people behind. SPACE is imprinted in large type across the upper part; SONY is imprinted immediately below on the left, once horizontally and twice vertically, surrounding a white rectangular space. There are two additional blanks in white below the  Sony area and three smaller white blanks on the lower right. \nThe videocassette case reproduces a photograph of the upper part of a face, showing eyes, brows and a cut out inverted V shape simulating a nose. Chiat Day Mojo's Greated Hits- A tape that will forever prove that commercials are better than T.V. shows is imprinted across the top. \nThe audiocassette liner, recto, reproduces a partial profile view of a man's face, showing an ear and hair. Radio is imprinted on the left and What it would sound like if Chiat Day Mojo was the world's only agency on the right. On the verso is a cover design for an audiocassette, a Touch of Class, featuring the figure of a man in white tie and tails, with The Mighty Sparrow superimposed in shocking pink letters.",
