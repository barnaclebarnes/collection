    "description": "As a working copy, this object shows the development of the Chiat\/Day self-promotion piece, Loomings. (See 1993-151-416.) Two pages of text, recto and verso of one sheet, are headed Chapter I, Loomings. Page three of the text is mounted on cardboard, which on the outside gives the appearance of actual pages, but is incised on the inside to hold three booklets, a fake chocolate bar and two pencils. (There is space for six pencils, but only two are included, as is an incised circle for a U.S. quarter, which is absent.) The top booklet, in black and white, has a cover image of a television screen, imprinted Hello in the center, and promotes the Chiat\/Day agency. Below is a second booklet with a map design cover, imprinted Mojo?, and blank pages within. Below that is a spiral bound booklet with a tan cardboard cover imprinted with the agency's name at the top and who's who? in the lower part, containing white pages imprinted with promotional material about various watch products. On the bottom layer are the pencils, one of which is imprinted Ciat (sp.) Day Mojo and has a sticker imprinted Good Clients; and the fake chocolate bar, imprinted food for thought, centered in white on black.",
