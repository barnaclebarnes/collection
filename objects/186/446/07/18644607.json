    "description": "The case, exterior covered in black fabric and labelled Relevant on the spine in hand-pasted gold paper letters, is designed to simulate a book. Within are two pages, recto and verso, headed Chapter 1, Loomings, followed by text. Page three, mounted on cardboard which on the outside gives the appearance of actual pages, is incised on the inside to hold three booklets, a fake chocolate bar, a U.S. quarter and six pencils. The cover image of the top booklet is a television screen in purple, imprinted in small black letters in the center. Multicolored pages within show various outdoor scenes and consumer products, interspersed with black or white lettered slogans promoting the Chiat\/Day agency. Below is another booklet with a map design cover, imprinted Mojo?, and blank pages within. Below that is a spiral bound booklet with a tan cardboard cover imprinted with the agency's name at the top and who's who? in the lower part, and containing white pages imprinted with promotional material about various watch products. On the bottom layer are the pencils, each imprinted Chiat Day Mojo and with a unique phrase: Critical mass, Good clients, Good people, Method, Religion, and Thank you; a fake chocolate bar imprinted food for thought centered in white on black; and the quarter.",
