    "description": "A woman's ceremonial skirt with a center panel of dark purplish-brown, with a design of interconnected diamonds with striped and dotted fillings created by buttonhole embroidery and withdrawn element work. A wide border on three sides has dark brown raffia cut-pile embroidery with interlacing patterns. Also on three sides, a heavy wrapped cord attached with a buttonhole variation in orange raffia, creating a form of ruffled edging.",

    "gallery_text": "The visual arts of the Kuba Kingdom have long been admired for their vitality and complexity, especially in the handling of abstract geometric surface design. Perhaps the most dynamic examples are raffia skirts worn for ceremonial occasions. Both men and women use a broad repertoire of decorative techniques, including tie-dye, appliqu\u00e9, patchwork and embroidery, but only women use cut-work and cut-pile embroidery, the two dominant techniques in this skirt. Each tuft of pile is a short length of raffia inserted with a needle under the warps of the foundation, and the two ends cut short. Brushing the exposed ends with the edge of a knife further splits the raffia ends and gives a rich, velvety texture. The undulating coil edging of this piece is created by wrapping and binding a thick rope of raffia to the edge of the skirt with buttonhole stitches; the tension introduced causes it to flip back and forth like an unruly cable.",
    "label_text": "Worn wrapped several times around the body, the layered borders of Kuba dance skirts draw the eye with the movement of tightly wrapped and coiled edgings, like this one. The upper edge flips down at the waist to create a second zone of movement, along with a majestic girth.",
