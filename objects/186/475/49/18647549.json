    "description": "Promtional poster for magazine, ARCHIS No. 8, '89.  All text in white on background composed of three vertical quadrilaterals in light blue against darken blue.  Text reads: \" ACRHIS No. 8, '89\/ \"I Believe that all great architects have failed.\/ Their work serves as an example precisely because it\/ has failed.  That is why modernity is still living; as\/ a failture, not as a success.\"\/ DANIEL LIBESKIND\/ ARCHIS No. 3, '89\/ \"For a good three years now I have been occupied\/ in ridding myself of the stigma of modernity,\/ just beacuse in the netherlands it is practised with,\/ such indolence.\"\/ Rem Koolhaas\/ ARCHIS No. 1, '93\/ \"Visions of genius are part of social climate.  What\/ I don't like is for these references to be derived,\/ so that a Picasso is regarded as having sprung from \"Nothing\".\"\/ Hermann Pitz\/ ARCHIS No. 1, '93\/ \"At the present time, we architects have ideals\/ which are held in check by irony.  Irony is a\/ moderate emotion, it isn't satire, it isn't coarse,\/ it's laughing at yourself a bit.  But that laughter\/ is very serious.\"\/ Denise Scott Brown\/ ARCHIS No. 11, '92\/ \"Let us at least bear witness, time and time again,\/ and for no-one, to thought as a catastrophe, as\/ nomadism, as disparity and unemployment.\/  If we cannot make engravings, let us at least do\/ our graffiti.\"\/ Jean-Francois Lyotard. \"  Three rows of dots in quotes.  Imprinted at right over three squares: \"YOUR NAME HERE\" (in white)\/ ARCHIS (in black, across bottom)\/ THE DUTCH OUTLOOK ON ARCHITECTURE\" (in white).  Geometric shapes and lines at bottom.",
