    "description": "Oval hand mirror consisting of gutta-percha handle and back, the straight handle simulating entwined branches and the back decorated with a griffon, bird and foliage. Beveled oval mirror with narrow gilded metal surround.",
    "justification": "The molded Renaissance-style ornament of this gutta percha mirror is especially crisp and refined in character. Gutta percha is a natural plastic, made from an East Indian tree resin. Introduced into Europe in the 1820s, it became popular for use in molded furniture elements and small items during the last half of the 19th century. Because of its tendency to become brittle over time, it rarely survives in as good condition as in this piece.",
    "gallery_text": "Gutta-percha, a natural latex that derives from trees native to the Pacific Rim, was first introduced to the Western world in the mid-seventeenth century, but it was not until the 1840s\u2014when it was \"rediscovered\" by an English traveler in Malaysia\u2014that it was truly popularized as a medium for design. Gutta percha is hard and inelastic in its natural state, but when heated in water, it softens and can be pressed into a cold mold to create a variety of forms. It most famously was used to make teeth fillings and golf balls, both beginning in 1848, and a decade later, as an insulation and coating material for the first transatlantic telegraph cable. Nineteenth-century craftsmen also embraced gutta percha as a decorative material, as shown by this hand mirror with flora and fauna motifs in relief on the backside and a handle resembling a leaf-covered tree trunk, which is completed in detail and with skill. Although gutta-percha objects were sturdier than those made of rubber, they remained brittle, and many artefacts have been lost over time. Contemporary pattern books and trade catalogs attest to its once wide variety of applications, including jewelry, hair combs, and other domestic accessories.",
