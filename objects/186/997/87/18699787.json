    "description": "Sanitary wallpaper with repeating design of a large ship at sea, framed within rolling waves and dolphins.  Printed in blue and green on white ground.",
    "justification": "This is a sanitary wallpaper designed by Christopher Dresser. The design was shown in the fine and decorative arts magazine, The Studio, in 1899.\nSanitary papers were first developed in the 1870s in response to cries from healthcare workers that wallpapers were unhealthy. Prior to sanitary papers, wallpapers were all printed with water-soluble pigments and could not be cleaned. While these papers were not \u201cwashable,\u201d they could be wiped with a damp cloth. Sanitary papers were advocated for use with children, the elderly, kitchens, washrooms and work rooms. Sanitary papers remained in production at least into the 1920s.",
    "gallery_text": "This design was first produced as a cretonne or printed cotton and was illustrated in \"The Studio\" magazine in 1899, and was later printed as a wallpaper by the Leroy firm in Paris in 1902. This paper is a flexographic print, printed with non-water-soluble inks using rubber rollers, and it is believed to have been printed at the Lightbown Aspinall factory of the Wall Paper Manufacturers ca. 1968. Dresser was a major proponent of the Aesthetic style popular in the late 19th century where motifs were rendered very flat so as not to imply any sense of depth. With its rolling waves and wind-blown sails this design suggests action more than depth. There is no suggestion of highlights or shadows and the only sense of depth is created by the overlapping of elements.",
