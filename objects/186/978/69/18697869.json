    "description": "Designed in a bold woodcut technique. Tropical scenes showing a black female figure in a grass skirt, her arms balancing a keg placed on her head; a pipe-smoking sailor, hands on hips, standing next to a barrel, against a distant sailing ship. Both scenes surrounded by tropical foliage, coconut palm trees and water. Printed in ochre, sienna, black and white.",

    "gallery_text": "This design is printed in a two column format, with a view of a soldier standing next to a keg or barrel, in front of a tall ship alternating with the silhouette of a woman wearing a grass skirt, carrying a container on her head. The two views are enframed by lush tropical foliage and coconut palm trees. \nLaboureur was a painter, draftsman, illustrator and printmaker. He attended the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris in 1896 and studied printmaking. Around 1912 he became influenced by cubism which made a significant change in his artistic style. He had his first major exhibition at Gallery Andr\u00e9 Groult in Paris and later that same year enlisted in the British Army. Laboureur made a series of prints expressing his views of the war, and this theme reappears in some of his later works.",
    "label_text": "Paul Frankl was a champion of modernism. He established his first gallery in New York City, which offered interior design services, custom furniture, and imported and domestic decorative objects and fabrics. Frankl Galleries began offering modern wallpapers around1927, including patterns by top European designers such as Josef Hillerbrand, Dagobert Peche, and Andr\u00e9 Groult. Donated by Frankl Galleries, this group of wallpapers became the first contemporary patterns, as well as the first machine-printed wallpapers, acquired for the museum\u2019s collection.",
