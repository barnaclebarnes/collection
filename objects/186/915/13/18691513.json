    "justification": "The object proposed for acquisition is a rare example of S\u00e8vres porcelain dating from the early 1950s. Examples from the period immediately following World War II are scarce. \nMuch of French design in the early 1950s remained entrenched in a sensibility initially established in the 1940s, when high-style interiors and objects by designers such as Jacques Adnet, Gilbert Poillerat, Serge Roche, Emilio Terry, Raymond Subes, Jean Roy\u00e8re, and Jean Cocteau, were introduced to the marketplace. Evident in much of their work is an ample dose of the theatrical and the surreal, all of which borders on an almost mannerist tendency. Popular themes, often seen in stage design, window displays, table settings, and so forth, were astrology, the cosmos, and the sea. \nThis S\u00e8vres vase displays symbols that appear to be from the Greek zodiac, along with calligraphy evocative of Arabic script. Its slightly metaphysical qualities are not unlike some of those seen in collaborations between Gio Ponti and Piero Fornasetti in Italy during the same period. These illustrative features are also somewhat reminiscent of Raymond Loewy's Script china for Rosenthal, also produced in the early 1950s. Works from S\u00e8vres were always intended for a luxury market. Despite this, attempts were made to embrace modernism. The form of this particular vase was designed by Maurice Gensoli, who was active in the manufactory's design department from about 1925 through the late 1950s. Less is known about Rabaey, but his whimsical and elegant decoration is very suggestive of the period. \nWhile the museum has very fine examples of S\u00e8vres from both the 18th and 19th century, Jeux de Fonds - Astronomie would be the first strong piece of 20th-century S\u00e8vres porcelain to join the collection. The vase is suggestive of a very rich period in French design and would enhance the museum\u2019s holdings in 20th-century French works.\nReferences: \nArt et Industrie, 1948\u201351.\nConnaissance des Arts, 1960, 52-57.\nBruno Foucart, Jean-Louis Gaillemin, and Yves Gastou, Les de\u0301corateurs des anne\u0301es 40 (Paris: Norma, 1999).\nJean-Paul Midant, Se\u0300vres: la manufacture au XXe\u0300me sie\u0300cle (Paris: M.
