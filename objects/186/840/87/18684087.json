    "justification": "Eva Lisa (Pipsan) Saarinen Swanson is part of an influential design family. Her father was the architect and designer Eliel Saarinen, her mother was the textile designer and sculptor, Loja Saarinen, and her brother was architect Eero Saarinen. Pipsan was born in Finland in 1905 and moved with her family to the United States in 1923. The family eventually settled in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where Saarinen became the resident architect at the Cranbrook Academy of Art. Pipsan was involved with her father\u2019s projects at Cranbrook, including designing decorative motifs for the Cranbrook School for Boys (1926), the Saarinen House (1930), and the Kingswood School Cranbrook (1931). She began teaching costume and interior design at Cranbrook in the early 1930s and collaborated on interior design projects with her husband\u2019s architectural firm. (Her husband, J. Robert F. Swanson, was a former student of Saarinen\u2019s). In 1939, she created, with her husband and father, the Flexible Home Arrangements group of furniture, manufactured by Johnson Furniture Company of Grand Rapids, Michigan, to provide contemporary furniture appropriate to the modern structures Swanson was designing.\nThe Saarinen Swanson Group debuted in 1947, with integrated designs for furniture, fabrics, lamps, metalwork, glassware, and pottery. In addition to Pipsan and Swanson, other designers who contributed to the Saarinen Swanson Group were textile designer Marianne Strengell, ceramist Lydia Winston, architect and designer Benjamin Baldwin, and sculptor Charles Dusenbury. \nThe Saarinen Swanson Group formed to embody contemporary design and offer versatility and affordability for the modern postwar home. In addition to the Flower Floater\/Candleholder no. 5905-20, Pipsan\u2019s other designs for the Saarinen Swanson Group included screen printed textiles for the Goodall Fabric Company of New York, lights for the Mutual Sunset Lamp Manufacturing Company of New York, and modestly-priced glassware for the United States Glass Company in Tiffin, Ohio. Pipsan later provided a successful line of indoor outdoor furniture, the Sol-Air Group, produced by Ficks Reed Company; her textile designs in the 1950s and 1960s included screen printed fabrics for Edwin Raphael Company, an award-winning design shown at the Brussels World\u2019s Fair in 1958, and rug designs for E. T. Barwick Mills.[1]  \nThe Flower Floater\/Candleholder no. 5905-20 is in excellent condition and will help Cooper-Hewitt\u2019s collection tell more fully the story of modernist glass design in the immediate postwar years. It will join work in our collection from designers like Russel Wright (for Morgantown) and George Sakier (for Fostoria). Pipsan\u2019s work also helps to document designs by the prominent Saarinen family, and will serve to highlight the still undersung contributions of female designers during this period. \n\n[1] Ashley Brown, Backgrounds for Modern Living: Furniture, Textile, and Fashion Designs by Pipsan Saarinen Swanson (Bloomfield Hills, MI: Cranbrook Art Museum, 1999).",
    "gallery_text": "Eva Lisa (\u201cPipsan\u201d) Saarinen Swanson, often forgotten in the historical shadows of her famous architect\/designer father and brother, Eliel and Eero Saarinen, was a well-established midcentury modern designer in her own right. In 1929, Saarinen Swanson opened an interior design department in her husband\u2019s architectural office, and shortly after the founding of Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1932, taught the school\u2019s first contemporary furniture design course, among other classes. She designed furnishings, textiles, interiors, and glasswares, including this flower floater and candle holder for the Saarinen Swanson Group of integrated furnishings and home decor. The line was introduced at the Johnson Furniture Company showroom in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1947. Saarinen Swanson was one of six designers who produced goods for the line. The flower floater and candle holder holds four tall, tapered candles near each of the bowl\u2019s biomorphic edges, and flowers or petals are intended to lie on its base. It embodies the organic lines and heavy, clear glass of modern Swedish wares. Saarinen Swanson Group pieces were modestly priced, intended to bring contemporary design into postwar middle-class homes through versatile, comfortable pieces with affordable prices.",
