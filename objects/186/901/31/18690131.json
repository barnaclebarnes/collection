    "description": "Two sheets joined together with \"sticky\" tape showing eleven different forms of waste can including the \"Garbo\", elliptical \"eye,\" amorphic and hourglass shapes, some in plan and most in perspective views.  \nThe \"Garbo\" title is play on \"garbage\" referring to the function of the object, and \"Greta Garbo\" alluding to the actress's famous profile mirrored in the shape of the design.",

    "gallery_text": "Born in Cairo, Karim Rashid has worked in London, Canada, and New York, where he opened his office in 1993. He calls his aesthetic, exemplified in these designs for a waste can, \u201csensual minimalism.\u201d The Italian manufacturer Umbra fabricated the design shown in the left-center in 1996. A salesperson likened the can\u2019s curves to the silhouette of film star Greta Garbo in a strapless gown, giving the waste basket its name, \u201cGarbo.\u201d From a practical standpoint, the curving top acts as a rim to catch thrown trash, the handles make it appear taller, and the rounded base, which Rashid noted with an arrow on this page, allows for easy cleaning. Rashid begins the design process by hand-drawing many versions of a product in a ring-binder sketchbook, sometimes drawing hundreds of options before arriving at a final form. He then relies on computer-aided-design (CAD) software to complete the design. Rashid\u2019s Garbo can was praised for its combination of sleek elegance, modernism, and affordability, thanks to both the plastic material and his understanding of the manufacturing process. (He claims the first plastic injection of this can resulted in an unusually perfect mold.) The simple bin, millions of which have been sold, launched him to design stardom.",
