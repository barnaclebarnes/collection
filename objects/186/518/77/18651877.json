    "gallery_text": "Art Chantry\u2019s aesthetic is a mash-up of re-appropriated imagery and text; his posters are collages with Do-It-Yourself sensibility. Inspired partly by punk aesthetics and zine culture, Chantry\u2019s designs often remind the viewer that much of what we see in advertising and packaging is born of vernacular culture. Often humorous and subversive, Chantry avoids the computer as a tool for production,  instead preferring a hands-on approach by employing techniques such as cutting, pasting, layering to achieve eclectic, varied designs through low-tech means. His design work for independent record labels, commercial clients and political and community events, always on a low budget and with a quick turnaround, remains influential and much imitated today.",
