    "gallery_text": "Tassels are typically made from richly colored, glossy silk. Passementerie, or the art of making tassels, fringes, pompoms and cords, is an early word for lace, and the bobbin lace technique is believed to have evolved from the making of braided silk and metal trimmings. These white linen tassels combine the skills of the passementier, braiding and knotting, with the materials and techniques of the lace-maker, in one case, of stitching tiny lace flowers and figures. One use for tassels such as these is for the cincture of the alb, a long white linen tunic worn under elaborate silk church vestments. Others are seen in Dutch portraits of the seventeenth century, fastening the necks of men\u2019s shirts, hanging just below their elaborate lace falling collars. In Italian painting, they can be seen adorning domestic linens, while the largest examples may have found use in bed furnishings.",
