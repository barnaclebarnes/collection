    "description": "Souvenir folder: On the textured paper, orange colored cover, diagonally from the lower left to the upper right, Souvenir is imprinted in bold sans serif type upper case, with identical six-spoked ideograms at the beginning and end of the word. On the inside flap (right), Fresh is imprinted vertically in a type resembling Fraktur; AIGA\/N. Y. is imprinted near the upper edge and 6-4-86 near the lower.\n\nInvitation: Recto - On the left, centered, five lines type of calligraphic type comprise an invitation to the symposium. Two additional lines directly below; two diagonal lines on either side; and the AIGA return address in the upper left-hand corner complete the left side. The right side, separated from the left by a thin line, is the recipient address panel, on which You are invited: is imprinted in the center in calligraphic type. Verso - The entire left side, headed A.I.G.A.\/N.Y in calligraphic type, states the symposium theme, Design without Designers, imprinted in the same type, and continues with commentary in a humorous vein, in a sans serif type. The right side, featuring three columns headed Who? Who? and What?, are outlined and divided by thin lines; program speakers and subjects are listed within. An additional line of type, printed along the right-hand edge from bottom to top, credits the participants in the design and production of the invitation.\n\nFolder contents: Seventeen black-and-white inserts in deliberately bargain basement production style are fictional advertisements characterized by jokes and puns, such as: See David and Jane prove again the die-hard Bauhaus notion that industry is art (insert a) and Tibor's Meat Specialties\/ 1508 2 Av (insert b).",
