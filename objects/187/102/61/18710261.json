    "gallery_text": "While sketching ideas for a poster to announce the annual Beaux Arts Ball at the Architectural League of New York in 1999, graphic designer Michael Bierut realized that the words in that year\u2019s theme, \u201cLight Years,\u201d had five letters each. He thought to overlay them. Nicole Trice, then an intern at Pentagram \u2014an international design firm where Bierut has been a partner since 1990 \u2014  mixed Bierut\u2019s simple concept with digital effects. Using Photoshop to create a solution implying light, shadow, and transparency, her collaboration with Bierut produced an image rich with implied temporality. Overlapping the two words in a white font \u2014Interstate designed by Tobias Frere-Jones  \u2014created a luminescent effect that seems to flit across the black background the way film titles energetically come to life from old movie projectors. The poster even played a supporting role in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s film Side Effects (2012), which was partially shot in the New York offices of Pentagram.",
    "label_text": "While sketching concepts for the poster, Bierut saw that \u201clight\u201d and \u201cyears\u201d are both five-letter words, so he decided to run the two words through each other. The layers of text have been digitally manipulated to resemble projected light.",
