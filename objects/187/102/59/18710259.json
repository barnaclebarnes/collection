    "gallery_text": "One of the most celebrated and well-known graphic designers of our day, Michael Bierut has had a long-standing relationship with Yale University\u2019s School of Architecture. Since 1998,  he has been asked to create printed matter that reflects the discourse taught within the school. Part of a series of posters designed for the university, Next Cities visually represents the themes discussed throughout a symposium, which took place on October 6\u20137, 2000. Bierut artfully mixed black and white overlapping squares to create density on the paper, likening the graphics to a city block.  The poster uses a grid as an underlying organizational tool; the squares combine with text in a highly structured way. The design harks back to Bierut\u2019s time working for Massimo Vignelli, as the Italian designer stressed the importance working within a grid to achieve great design.  Bierut has been the recipient of numerous awards throughout his career, including Cooper Hewitt\u2019s Design Mind Award in 2008.",
