    "description": "Modified gothic\/arabic black script reading \"seduction\" across upper section of poster. Long sinuous lines extend from the serif edges creating an open network of thin hair-like spirals. Informational text arranged in vertical columns below center.",
    "justification": "The titling for Seduction, a poster for the Yale School of Architecture Symposium January 20\u201321, 2007, was commissioned by Pentagram. Marian Bantjes uses a calligraphic synthesis of Gothic and Arabic type fonts to create lettering that seems familiar yet new. The slightly sinister sensation is enhanced by the juxtaposition of thick, fleshy volumes tapering to a curling hair line. \nA trend in contemporary design is the reexamination of the use of ornament as a counterpoint to the traditional clarity of the grid. Bantjes mines the history of calligraphy, type design, ornament, and oriental symbols and enlivens their compositions. Self-consciously autobiographical in tone, Bantjes's elaborate samplings of images, flourishes, and fonts take graphic design in a fresh new direction.",
    "gallery_text": "Visual artist, typesetter, designer, and writer Marian Bantjes is well known for her highly original ornamental style of calligraphy, lettering, and illustration.  Her characteristic pieces feature obsessive handwork and patterning, but she doesn\u2019t shy away from technology: Bantjes sketches on graph paper and then scans them into the digital program Illustrator for final tracing and development.  Originally from Canada, Bantjes\u2019s unmistakable talent caught the eye of American graphic designer Michael Bierut, of Pentagram, who commissioned her to design the sultry, curvilinear type for the poster Seduction for the Yale School of Architecture\u2019s 2007 symposium. The collaboration brought together their individual strengths to create a strong visual image: Bierut\u2019s expertise with organizing type and layout and Bantjes\u2019s emotive calligraphy.  With a background in typesetting and graphic design , the polymath writes, draws, designs, and creates works of art. She left her shared studio practice in 2002 to work on her own  and now devotes her time to commissions from a variety of art directors and designers.",
