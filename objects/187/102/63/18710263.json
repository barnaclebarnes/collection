    "gallery_text": "Michael Bierut \u2014partner at international design firm Pentagram, co-founder of the website Design Observer, and senior critic at the Yale School of Architecture\u2014 designed his first posters for Yale\u2019s design program in 1998 when the architect Robert A. M. Stern was appointed dean.  This book contains forty of Bierut\u2019s commissions from the school, honoring his longstanding relationship with both Yale and Stern, who wrote the introduction to this published collection. The stark black-and-white posters promoted Yale\u2019s conferences, public programs, and open houses. An embossed cover features twenty of Bierut\u2019s varying renditions of Yale\u2019s trademark \u201cY\u201d symbol, which Bierut uniquely designed for every poster. (He also selected a different typeface for each one. ) Here, it is diversity that creates an aesthetic consistency among this group, deviating from the cohesive approach of past designers to work with Yale, such as Paul Rand and Norman Ives.",
