    "justification": "The majority of this group of wallpapers proposed for acquisition are loose pages removed from two French art deco sample books produced by the J. Grantil Company between 1928 and 1930. The samples are a mix of exuberant and vivid designs, in both modern and traditional styling. There are many examples of matching sidewall and border papers, sidewall coordinates, and independent sidewall papers. The sidewall coordinates could be used alone or together, creating some very striking interiors. A number of the samples have applied lithograph illustrations showing these coordinates in situ. The two books contain similarly styled papers though there are no duplicates. Many of the samples have unique textural patterns, both printed and embossed. This group of wallpapers exhibits the boldness, elegance and sophistication characteristic of the French art deco era. \nThe remaining papers, unrelated to the Grantil production, are individual samples representing French, English, American, and Belgian manufacture, dating from about 1815 to 1960. The samples include wood block and machine-printed papers, and comprise a wide range of styles and periods, such as Aesthetic and art nouveau. Several of the sidewall papers are designed and produced by Andr\u00e9 Groult, Paul Gruin, Paul Follot, and Shand Kydd. \nThe significance of this group of papers lies in the wide variety of matching sidewall and border papers, pendant medallions, and wallpaper coordinates. The acquisition of this group would more than double the museum\u2019s holdings of French art deco papers, providing a much more complete representation of wall treatments available from French manufacturers around 1930.",
