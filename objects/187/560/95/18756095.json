    "description": "Strips of coiled newsprint are woven with nylon filaments on handlooms in the manner of grasscloth. Made from 100% recycled newsprint.",
    "justification": "Newsworthy, by textile designer Lori Weitzner, combines age-old techniques with the modern notion of recycling. Woven on handlooms using the same technique as traditional grasscloth, the wallpaper is composed of 100% recycled newspaper and nylon filament.\nThe bulk of the world\u2019s grasscloth has always been made in Japan. Traditionally woven from the bark of the honeysuckle vine, grasscloth\u2019s use as a wallcovering dates back hundreds of years. Evidence of its use is found in ancient temples. The stages of production slowly became standardized, and some mechanized, after Japan was introduced to Western markets. Grasscloth was first exported to the United States in the 1880s.\nNewsworthy is woven in India on traditional handlooms using coiled newsprint for the weft and nylon filaments as the warp. This gives the paper strength and keeps it flexible. After the paper is woven, it is shipped back to the United States where it is paper-backed to facilitate being pasted to the wall. As with grasscloth, slight variations in color are inherent in the product. The finished product does not receive any additional surface treatment.\nWeitzner studied textile design at Syracuse University and has designed lines for notable textile firms including Sahco, Jack Lenor Larsen, Carnegie Fabrics, Missoni, and Loop. She has also developed packaging for Est\u00e9e Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, and Calvin Klein. She collaborated with Frog Design on interior furnishings for Lufthansa Airlines and with Johnson & Johnson and Proctor & Gamble on clinical products for women. In 2004, she introduced her first line of wallcoverings under the name Weitzner Limited. She continues to achieve stunning results using uncommon materials in her creation of innovative wallcoverings, including a number that are environmentally conscious. Weitzner is based in New York.\nNewsworthy would help grow the museum\u2019s collection of eco-friendly and sustainable textiles, which is an area of museum collection focus.",
    "gallery_text": "Woven on handlooms in the same technique as traditional grasscloth wallcoverings, Newsworthy is composed of 100% recycled newspaper and nylon filament. Each of the woven strips is quite narrow so none of the patterns or colors dominate. Instead, the subtle bits of pattern and color result in a nice all-over texture.",
