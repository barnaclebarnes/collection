    "description": "Roughly rectangular form, the ebony and carnelian surface with applied fragment of Egyptian faience figure in center, flanked by gold heart in scale above gold feet on left, jackle's head hoding scale with feather on right; turquoise beads applied along left and right edges, and center top and bottom edges.",
    "justification": "The Weighing of the Heart brooch, by goldsmith Kevin Coates, was inspired by the Egyptian Book of the Dead, a guide to the soul\u2019s journey through the underworld. According to Coates, \u201cThe Anubis amulet which forms the center of my \u2018page,\u2019 however, has lost both its hands and feet, but retained, despite its small scale, [a sense] of hieratic monumentality. I was able to recreate the deficient parts in gold, and by creating a divided field of shadow and light (ebony and carnelian), to install them as part of the judgment in which the heart is weighed against a feather (symbol of Maat, justice, and Divine Order).\u201d Coates carries this theme and imagery into the slate mount he created for the brooch\u2014a thought-provoking object of adornment to wear on one\u2019s body or to display in an interior. \nCoates is one of England\u2019s leading contemporary goldsmiths. His training began at London\u2019s Central School of Art, and he received his MA from the Royal College of Art in 1976. He is known for his technical virtuosity and his symbolic imagery, which draws from mythology, folklore, mathematics, and music (he is also a noted musician and musicologist). A number of museums and institutions have commissioned or collected his jewelry and metalwork vessels, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, and the Wallace Collection in London; the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh; and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. \nThis brooch relates directly to Egyptian antiquities in the museum\u2019s collection. Its stylistic references and hand production techniques also relate to the museum\u2019s collection of work by goldsmiths and jewelers from the Middle Ages through the 19th century. In addition, this piece relates to contemporary jewelry in the collection, such as works by Barbara Natoli Witt, who uses beads and ancient fragments in woven necklace forms.",
