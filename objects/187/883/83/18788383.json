    "justification": "Turret is a pair of spiral-form earrings by the American designer, Ted Muehling. Muehling, who is based in New York, is a versatile designer across media. Although primarily known for his jewelry designs, the museum also has examples of his glassware produced by the Lobmeyr firm and collaborated with the designer on the exhibition, Ted Muehling Selects: Lobmeyr Glass from the Permanent Collection. \nThese earrings exemplify Muehling\u2019s approach to interpreting nature in a contemporary way. He will take a seemingly mundane natural form (like a seed, for example) and will render it in a way that emphasizes the beauty of the simple form. Some of his work elaborates a simple form into more complex design, such as, in this case, the suggestion of a spiral shell.",
