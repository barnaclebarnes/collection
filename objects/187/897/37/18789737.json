    "justification": "Henning Watterston was one of the most successful weaver\/designers of the postwar period. He studied painting and textile design at the Rudolph Schaeffer School of Design in San Francisco. In 1941 he and his wife, Carolyn Rees, joined Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Taliesin Fellowship, where they designed and wove curtains for Wright\u2019s Rose Pauson House in Phoenix, Arizona. Through the 1940s, Watterston became well-known for his textural casements designed for Menlo Textiles. In 1949, he moved his studio to New York. Through the 1950s, he designed high-end and custom fabrics for decorators, and worked with Craftex Mills in Philadelphia. He was working with Craftex when he developed Bangkok for Knoll. \nWatterston believed in the importance of understanding and showcasing the \u201ctexture identity of thread.\u201d With a warp of Talsan textured nylon from DuPont and a weft of slub-spun nylon, Bangkok gave the appearance of silk shantung. The luxury effect was amplified in the coloring, which borrowed the jewel tones and iridescent effects of Thai silks.",
