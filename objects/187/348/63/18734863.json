    "description": "The album cover image consists of a grid of black dots arranged in ten stacked rows on a white field. Some of the dots that form the eleventh row float above the others and create a syncopated rhythm. The words Persuasive Percussion are printed across the top edge of the cover. \nTop right, printed in black: Stereo \/ RS 800 SD\nBottom right printed in black: C 1959 Award Publishing Corporation\nBottom right black dot has a symbol resembling an \"A\"",
    "justification": "This is one of a set of seven album covers (1959\u201361) designed by Josef Albers for Command Records. The compositions for the series are abstract, relying on differences of scale and color to convey syncopation, rhythm, and tone. In Persuasive Percussion, dots appear to be released from a rigid grid of dots below to hover randomly in space. \nAlbers, principally associated with the Bauhaus in Dessau, Germany, prior to teaching at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, was instrumental in developing the Department of Design at Yale University. His investigation of color theory is best known through his series of paintings and prints, Homage to the Square (begun in 1949), and his publication, Interaction of Color (1963), which influenced color field painting and the conceptual artists of the 1960s.\nCommand Records was founded in 1959 by Enoch Light, a classically trained violinist active as a band leader and recording entrepreneur after World War II. Bringing a high degree of sophistication to the marketing of stereo recordings, Light selected and arranged musical compositions, taking advantage of the right-left channelization of the new stereo equipment. To match the avant-garde nature of the musical compositions, Light asked Albers to produce designs that would evoke the syncopated spirit of the music and suggest the avant-garde nature of the music scene. Each cover in the series is a visual metaphor for the tempos and rhythms of the instruments featured on the tracks, including marimbas, trap sets, and bongos. Additionally, these albums showcase the innovative gatefold cover, which was first introduced by Light for Command Records. The gatefold design allowed for expanded liner notes and technical commentary pertaining to the production of the stereo recordings. \nThe critic Martin Filler has commented on how gestalt perception influenced Albers\u2019s designs for the Command Records album covers. According to Filler, Albers is able to graphically convey the effect of listening to the musical arrangements by equating the sounds of the percussion instruments to abstract geometrical forms of varying size. Albers was known to have been interested in gestalt theory as early as 1930, when he attended lectures on the subject delivered by Count Karlfried von D\u00fcrckheim at the University of Leipzig. Other colleagues of Albers at the Bauhaus, including Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee, were also keenly interested in the implications of gestalt theory on modern painting.\nThis is one of four Albers designs for Command Records under consideration for acquisition. These works will enhance the museum\u2019s collection of graphic design by significant designers of second half of 20th century.",
    "gallery_text": "Color theorist, designer, and artist Josef Albers designed seven record sleeve covers for Command Records in 1959\u201361, which proved to be groundbreaking, like much of his other work. Enoch Light founded Command in an effort to make what was a niche, audiophile style\u2014alternatively called stereo, exotica, hi-fi, percussive\u2014accessible to a mainstream audience. As part of that effort, he commissioned Albers to design a sleeve cover for Persuasive Percussion, the first album produced by Command. Light wanted to move away from the sexy and sensual scenes dominating exotica store racks at that time. Albers\u2019s modernist, abstract aesthetic was an exemplary match. In discussing his paintings of squares, Albers said, \u201cA circle cannot sit.\u201d Here, circles dance as metaphors for the vinyl record\u2019s percussive sounds. Light\u2019s innovative musical styling and the luxurious modernist cover style were mimicked endlessly, and a trend for stereo percussion albums began.",
