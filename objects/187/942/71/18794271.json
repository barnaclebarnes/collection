    "justification": "Stefan Sagmeister\u2019s 2007 identity campaign for the Casa da M\u00fasica in Porto, Portugal, is a group of digital documents on a compact disc. The campaign was inspired by the Casa da M\u00fasica\u2019s iconic building, designed by the Dutch architect, Rem Koolhaas. The identity kit includes a video that shows the building\u2019s volume turning in space. The result is six building profiles with 17 different planes that can be applied as logo variations. The Sagmeister team also created a color tool that samples an existing image, such as a painting of Beethoven, to pull 17 different colors that can then fill in the facets of the logo\u2019s planes. \nSagmeister was born in Austria and studied graphic design at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna and at the Pratt Institute in New York. After short apprenticeships with Leo Burnett\u2019s Hong Kong Design Group and at M & Co., he opened his own firm in New York in 1993, Sagmeister Inc., which has since produced graphics, branding, and packaging for a variety of clients including Levi Strauss & Co., the Guggenheim Museum, and Time Warner Inc. Sagmeister was appointed to the Frank Stanton Chair at the Cooper Union School of Art and teaches in the graduate department of the School of Visual Arts, both in New York City. He has received almost every significant international design award, including the 2005 National Design Award in the field of Communications Design and two Grammys\u2014one that same year for his packaging for the Talking Heads box set, Once in a Lifetime, and a second in 2010 for his packaging for the David Byrne and Brian Eno collaboration, Everything That Happens Will Happen Today. \nSagmeister\u2019s graphic production is original and challenges the limits of his profession. This identity campaign, part of a larger group of objects by Sagmeister proposed for acquisition, will augment the museum\u2019s representation of work by this celebrated graphic designer.",
