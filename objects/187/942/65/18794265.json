    "description": "Poster advertisement for Levi's jeans. Recreation of jeans from its deconstructed thread.",
    "justification": "Graphic designer Stefan Sagmeister relishes the opportunity to get away from the computer screen and work in a more analog fashion. In 2009, Sagmeister and his design team deconstructed a pair of Levi\u2019s 501\u00ae button-fly jeans and used all of the individual elements to create a window installation for American Rag\u2019s Los Angeles store. The installation was reproduced in a limited run of 501 posters that were distributed in American Rag\u2019s Los Angeles and San Francisco boutiques. \nThe composition\u2019s shag carpet appearance grew from the difficulty of working with the unruly thread. The Sagmeister design team organized the thread, buttons, rivets, and labels in a collage using the white thread to spell out a label they found inside the pocket: \u201cThis is a Pair of Levis Sewed with the Strongest Thread.\u201d Among the elements that make this poster so appealing is its tactility\u2014it appeals to the viewer\u2019s sense of touch. This appeal to the personal, to the senses, and to the emotions, is characteristic of Sagmeister\u2019s work. \nSagmeister was born in Austria and studied graphic design at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna and at the Pratt Institute in New York. After short apprenticeships with Leo Burnett\u2019s Hong Kong Design Group and at M & Co., he opened his own firm in New York in 1993, Sagmeister Inc., which has since produced graphics, branding, and packaging for a variety of clients including Levi Strauss & Co., the Guggenheim Museum, and Time Warner Inc. Sagmeister was appointed to the Frank Stanton Chair at the Cooper Union School of Art and teaches in the graduate department of the School of Visual Arts, both in New York City. He has received almost every significant international design award, including the 2005 National Design Award in the field of Communications Design and two Grammys\u2014one that same year for his packaging for the Talking Heads box set, Once in a Lifetime, and a second in 2010 for his packaging for the David Byrne and Brian Eno collaboration, Everything That Happens Will Happen Today. \nSagmeister\u2019s graphic production is original and challenges the limits of his profession. This poster, part of a larger group of objects by Sagmeister proposed for acquisition, will augment the museum\u2019s representation of work by this celebrated graphic designer.",
    "gallery_text": "The Sagmeister team deconstructed a pair of Levi\u2019s 501 jeans, laid out the unruly thread, zipper, buttons, and rivets as an assemblage, and used the light-indigo thread to recreate words from the Levi\u2019s label. The assemblage was then photographed in high resolution, producing the poster\u2019s highly tactile effect.",
