    "justification": "This is one of two drawings proposed for acquisition that reveal Raymond Loewy\u2019s ideas for passenger car interior for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company (PRR). Loewy worked for the railroad from 1934 through 1952. Like his competitor, Henry Dreyfuss, who was hired by the New York Central Railroad, Loewy designed everything from locomotives (K4 class, S-1, GG-1, and T-1) and car interiors to dinnerware, napkins, and menus. \nThe earlier drawing (2012-1-2), dated 1935, represents a concept\u2014radical for its time\u2014for a streamline sleeper car and compartment with a double seat that partially unfolds to form a bed. The rolled seats, porthole windows, and speed lines on the walls are all characteristic elements of 1930s streamlining. \nWhile this streamline interior illustrates an idea that PRR was not yet ready to embrace, the second drawing (2012-1-1), dated a year later, represents a more practical, albeit less beautiful, solution to updating a car interior. This drawing shows a design for the MP-5 passenger car in which Loewy has merely restyled an existing commuter car by adding a streamline panel to the ends of the seats, coloring the seats a bright yellow, and changing the flooring to linoleum.\nNeither of the two Loewy drawings appears to have been implemented by the railroad, but both are important drawings as they were created relatively early in his career and illustrate two approaches utilized by the designer: one, an advanced concept drawing and, the other, a more pragmatic solution to modern styling.\nAt the time of proposed acquisition, the museum holds four Loewy drawings and one photostat showing redesigns of the K4 class of PRR locomotives. All of these, however, are exterior views. The two interiors under consideration would provide a fuller picture of Loewy\u2019s early work for the PRR, and would be a major addition to the museum\u2019s collection. The collection also includes a 1957 Dorothy Draper design for a Corvair 880 airplane lavatory, which complements the Loewy interior designs in the category of transportation design. In addition, the museum holds a large number of interior designs for 19th- and 20th-century spaces that would make interesting comparisons with the Loewy interiors.",
    "gallery_text": "The Pennsylvania Railroad was French-born Raymond Loewy's first large design contract, and one of his longest client relationships (1934\u20131952). The Pennsylvania wanted to modernize, and Loewy\u2014who would become known as a pioneer of the \"streamlining\" style\u2014worked on everything from train station garbage cans and toothpick wrappers to the entire train interior. Although the design shown in this drawing was never realized, it represents one of Loewy's early efforts to introduce a new American style to the Railroad. It was not the first American railroad company to use the streamlined style, but as the nation's leading railway, it was perhaps the most influential and far-reaching. Loewy's designs crisscrossed the nation, enveloping passengers in smooth edges, visual simplicity, expressive colors, and an overall sleek, modern feel. Beautifully colored illustrations like this one were an important step in his design process. Loewy was known as a showman, using his French accent and charm to full advantage; such illustrations alongside his salesmanship must have consistently stunned in client meetings, leading to Loewy\u2019s fame as one of the country\u2019s top industrial designers.",
