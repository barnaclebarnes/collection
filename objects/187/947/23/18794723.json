    "justification": "Frank Gehry, one of the most innovative architect-designers working today, is distinguished not only for his innovative forms and methods, but also for his use of unusual materials. Although he has previously designed one-off examples of lighting, the Cloud lamp for Vitra is his first serially-produced lamp. Gehry felt the name Cloud \u201cevokes the poetic nature\u201d of the lamp, suggestive of a light, fleecy, changing form; he intended it to convey a \"feeling of freedom and eccentricity.\"[1] He also saw it as an homage to Isamu Noguchi's paper Akiri lamps. Gehry has consistently explored paper and paper products as a design material, mostly recognizably in his cardboard furniture projects. \nGehry's first prototype for the Cloud lamp was made from flattened paper cups that he stapled together. The paper cup material, however, was not suitable for use near a hot light source, so a flame-resistant refined polyester was developed for use in the lamp instead. The form consists of circular polyester panels that resemble flattened paper cups snapped together at the edges. The soft, irregular, malleable shape is defined by ridges, creases, and dents. The basic spherical shape can be changed simply by pulling, pushing, or poking the form. Panels can be removed or added as desired to further customize the lamp\u2019s size and shape. Cloud speaks to end-user customization, a growing trend in contemporary design.",
    "gallery_text": "Gehry made his first prototype for this lamp from flattened paper cups stapled together. To replace the flammable paper, he developed a flame-resistant polyester. The basic spherical shape can be changed by pulling or poking the flexible form or by adding or removing panels, making the user a collaborator in the design.",
