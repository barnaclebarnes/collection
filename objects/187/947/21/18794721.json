    "justification": "TAR\/Tillett and Rauscher Inc., founded in 2006 by Seth Tillett and Nicole Rauscher, is an experimental textile hand-printing studio in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan. Tillett worked extensively in film, dance, and theater as a dramaturge, set, and lighting designer, in addition to creating installations. In 2000, he met Rauscher, a dancer and choreographer, and the two began collaborating on installations and performances involving graphics and textiles. \nTillett comes from a long line of English calico printers and grew up in his parents\u2019 studio on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. His parents, D. D. (Doris) and Leslie Tillett, of Tillett Fabrics Inc., produced custom textiles for Jackie Kennedy\u2019s White House restoration, style icon Babe Paley, and other influential clients. The Tilletts were also artists and experimenters and developed a number of unique printing techniques, such as the drag box\u2014a handmade tool for creating stripes and plaids without the use of a screen. In 2003, Rauscher apprenticed herself to D. D. and ran Tillett Fabrics. Even after co-founding TAR, Rauscher has continued to print Tillett Fabrics designs at the request of the company\u2019s longstanding interior design clients.\nLost Font was commissioned by a rare book dealer, who wanted something that reflected his love of print. Using a drag box modified to create stripes, Tillett and Rauscher applied black ink through a loosely woven jute mesh so that fragments of the woven structure appear. The cotton batiste was wetted immediately afterward so that irregular bleeding of the ink occurs, creating a soft gray shadow around the staccato black marks.\nTillett and Rauscher use a range of techniques so hand-intensive\u2014and produce results so unique\u2014that their practice calls into question the use of the term \"printing,\" which implies fast and cheap repetition. By creating tools and techniques with which the design is created directly on the fabric, the pair actively seeks to create non-repeating, non-repeatable patterns that embrace spontaneity and chance.",
