    "justification": "This textile by Claudy Jongstra is a prime example of felting, which is a technique that uses the application of pressure, heat, and moisture to mat together fibers. Often, the fibers are not spun or twisted, but are simply a mass of fibers lying indiscriminately in all directions. Two fabrics by Jongstra, Composition (SI 001), seen here, and Composition (DH\/WD\/SI 001), were both commissioned specifically for the museum\u2019s collection. They exemplify not only the general range of felting techniques, but also the variety of Jongstra\u2019s work. The refined and rippled fabric of this textile, Composition (SI 001), is made of wool merino, wild silk and cotton gauze, and reveals to the viewer the finesse of her craft, as opposed to the other example which looks as though it came straight of the back of the sheep.\nJongstra is a contemporary textile designer who practices the ancient technique of felting. Since the mid-1990s she has created extraordinary felted fabrics for fashion designers such as John Galliano, Christian Lacroix, and Donna Karan, and for architects and designers Steven Holl, Will Bruder, Jasper Morrison, and Marcel Wanders. Jongstra\u2019s fabrics have a raw elegance that comes from her use of materials such as wild silk, wild linen, and wild cashmere, as well as the special (and proprietary) techniques she has developed in her felting. Jongstra even goes so far as to raise her own sheep in the Dutch countryside and currently has a herd of 200, including the rare species of long-haired Drenthe Heath whose shorn locks she felts along with the straw and lanolin that accumulates on their hair.\nAt the time of proposed acquisition, the textile collection has relatively few examples of felt. As part of our collection plan, we would like to build up the museum\u2019s collection of this important technique in textile making.",
