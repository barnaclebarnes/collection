    "description": "Circular form, the center decorated with black, double-headed imperial eagle on green ground within a circular band of Cyrillic lettering (translation: Nicholas the Emperor and Ruler of All the Russias), surrounded by decoration of red flowers in gilded lozenges alternating with green foliate forms; the rim with green and blue foliage intertwined with black scrollwork on gilded ground.",
    "justification": "This plate was produced for the Kremlin service. The service was ordered by Nicholas I and was designed by Fedor Solntsev, who held an important position in the Imperial-sponsored movement of rediscovering and reinterpreting old Russian forms. Solntsev drew upon 17th-century metalwork as the model for this service, making use in particular of a gold dish designed in 1667 for the Tsarina Natalya Kirillovna.[1] The Grand Kremlin Palace was built by the architect K. A. Thon with a brief from the Tsar to create a building in the Russian style that also showed the influence of Byzantium. It was for this new Russian setting that the Kremlin service was designed. This plate has a specifically Russian design featuring the Imperial eagle surrounded by a Cyrillic inscription, which reads, \u201cNicholas the Emperor and Ruler of All the Russias\u201d on a richly decorated surface. \nThis plate is a very fine example of Russian Imperial porcelain. It would join our strong collection of Soviet porcelain from the time period, 1918\u201385, which includes the 250-piece Shapiro Collection. The museum also holds examples of fine porcelain from other European countries of the 18th and early 19th century.\n[1] L. Pisarskaya, N. G. Platonova, and B.
