    "description": "A dark green knit fabric with a varied and highly dimensional surface. Designed for the Ministry of Defense, United Kingdom, as a tank camouflage system called \"Quick Cam.\"",
    "justification": "This textile was designed in 1998 and manufactured in 2004 by Palmhive\u00ae Technical Textiles in England for the United Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Defence. It is composed of knitted polyester and Lycra and acts as three-dimensional camouflage for tanks and other military equipment. It is produced in the traditional camouflage colors of green, black, and khaki. The sculptural and highly textured surface of this stretch fabric disguises the large equipment it conceals. \nThe Palmhive\u00ae Bobble Camouflage Net demonstrates the ways in which fabrics can enhance safety, and also shows the unintended intrinsic beauty of many industrial textiles. This textile was part of the 2005 exhibition Extreme Textiles: Designing for High Performance and is now recommended for acquisition. The museum\u2019s collection contains historic and contemporary examples of knitted textile structures, but none with such a pure industrial application.",
