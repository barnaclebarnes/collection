    "justification": "This electric space heater prototype was designed in 1973 by Bill Moggridge. A departure from the black- or beige-box modernism of many industrial design objects of the period, this heater combines rational design with emotional appeal in a highly utilitarian object.\nThe heater is roughly the size of a large book. At first glance, it appears to be a minimal, rectangular outline. The solid black base with controls and the gently undulating red top and sides, however, comprise a form that expresses its essential function: warm air circulation. Air is drawn in through the side vents, compressed, and pushed out through the front by the heat exchanger. The colors and curves create a striking emotive quality, fitting for an object that provides warmth and comfort, and reflect the designer\u2019s consideration for the people who would use the heater in their homes. Looking almost like red waves of heat, the form also shows a sense of humor. Moggridge and his London-based firm, Moggridge Associates, designed the heater for Hoover Ltd., but it was never manufactured.\nThe heater prototype was featured in Cooper-Hewitt\u2019s Design USA exhibition (2009\u201310), which celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the National Design Awards (NDA) by showing the work of past winners. Moggridge, also the designer of the first laptop computer, the GRID Compass, and a pioneer in the field of interaction design, won the 2009 NDA award for Lifetime Achievement. Moggridge co-founded the Palo Alto based design consultancy IDEO and was the recipient of the prestigious British title, Royal Designer for Industry. He was among the first designers to integrate human factors into hardware and software design. His book and website, Designing Interactions, tells the story of how interaction design is transforming our daily lives. \nThis prototype heater would help grow the museum\u2019s collection of industrial design from the 1970s and would contribute to our collection of representative works by NDA finalists and winners.",
