    "justification": "American glass is one of the earliest industries in which American originality appears in commercially-produced objects. Pressed glass was first developed in the United States; other techniques associated with mass production and the use and development of certain colors also flourished. This was in contrast to the porcelain industry, which was more heavily reliant upon imports from England and France. \nThe Boston and Sandwich Glass Company, located in Sandwich, Massachusetts, was a top innovative producer of high quality glass in the second half of the 19th century. In 1825, Deming Jarvis started the Boston and Sandwich Glass Company in a small town on Cape Cod that was rich in fuel, had easy access to major waterways, and was located only 50 miles from Boston. Boats could dock at the plant, which facilitated the transport of goods. Despite its seaside location, Sandwich lacked fine sand, so sand was brought in from New Jersey and Western Massachusetts. Sandwich went out of business in 1888 due to labor disputes with newly-formed unions\u2014an ironic twist as the firm had provided more worker benefits throughout its history than many other companies. \nThis pitcher is a fine example of the explosion of interest in crackle glass in the 19th century. While the precise origins of this technique are unknown, Venetian glassmakers of the 16th century claim credit for similar work produced by plunging red-hot glass into cold water and then reheating and re-blowing it. Patents were issued in both the United States and England in the late 1870s and 80s. The process, known as \u201cice glass\u201d\u2014or \u201covershot,\u201d as created in Sandwich\u2014was incredibly popular.\nThis pitcher, along with the dish proposed for acquisition, would represent the first pieces of American ice glass in the museum\u2019s collection.",
