    "description": "Baby carrier with an upper rectangular section stiffened with a reed mat, and a soft lower square, with long tying straps. The upper section is of blackish-blue cotton with red cotton appliqu\u00e9 around the outside and forming three squares, all filled with fine embroidered geometric pattern in white. The lower square and straps are indigo blue, embroidered all over with a diamond grid of fine white cross-stitch embroidery in geometric and floral forms. Back lined with several pieces of indigo-dyed cotton in varied shades. Straps lined with undyed cotton.",
    "justification": "Most southwest Chinese ethnic groups, especially the Miao, are best known for their embroidery. Traditionally women\u2019s work, embroidery was a Miao girl\u2019s first attempt at needlework starting as early as four or five years old. Watching their mothers and other women in the community weave and embroider, they would later pass on this knowledge to the next generation. As one Miao woman explains, \u201cA woman\u2019s life is a dance with needle and thread. The book or painting of a woman\u2019s life is created using the needle as a pen or brush and thread as ink.\u201d Exquisitely woven and embroidered clothing and accessories, like this baby carrier (mei tai), were an important part of a girl\u2019s dowry and distinguished her by the skill and richness of decoration of the needlework. \nThis carrier, densely embroidered in cross stitch, contains what appears to be an ox horn motif, symbolizing the strength and endurance of the male reproductive organ. Some Miao cultures hang ox horns over the entrance to their homes to signify a growing family. To protect a child, parents will do as much as they can, including using clothing to achieve a mystical effect upon the baby. Baby carriers serve a very important function for the mother as they allow her to continue working without leaving her baby alone. There are many types of baby carriers, most of which hold the baby on the mother\u2019s back. This T-shaped carrier is probably the most typical; the baby rests between the top panel and the wearer\u2019s back with the belts wrapping around both of them to hold the baby in place. In this particular carrier, there is a flexible insert in the top panel, probably a reed mat, which would have given the baby additional support. The straps are wound over the wearer\u2019s shoulders, cross over the chest, and then wrap back around the baby\u2019s bottom to the front of the wearer, where it is tied at her waist. \nDistinctive about this carrier is the decoration of the straps themselves, which reflect the same motifs as the panels. Because the straps received the heaviest wear-and-tear, they would often be replaced. In this piece, however, the original straps are intact, likely indicating that this carrier would have only been used for special occasions.",
