    "justification": "This drawing by Ward Bennett shows the American designer\u2019s mind at work for objects in a variety of media during the initial stages of creation. In this drawing, Bennett has conceived an ambitious range of objects including cookware, kitchen utensils, and glassware. Although many of the projects illustrated on this sheet were probably unrealized, the objects share Bennett\u2019s aesthetic of simple geometries noted in other examples of his work in the museum\u2019s collection.\nThis sheet, in conjunction with other preparatory sheets by Bennett in the museum\u2019s collection, allows us to more fully understand how he approached the act of designing. Bennett\u2019s drawings complement other major Cooper-Hewitt holdings like those of Donald Deskey, Henry Dreyfuss, and Gerald Gulotta, all of which document the history of American 20th-century industrial design.",
