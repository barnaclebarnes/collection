    "description": "White political poster with black text. Text reads: \"THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING A WOMAN ARTIST:\/ Working without the pressure of success.\/ Not having to be in shows with men.\/ Having an escape from the art world in your 4 free-lance jobs.\/ Knowing your career might pick up after you're eighty.\/ Being reassured that whatever kind of art you make it will be labeled feminine.\/ Not being stuck in a tenured teaching position.\/ Seeing your ideas live on in the works of others.\/ Having the opportunity to choose between a career and motherhood.\/ Not having to choke on those big cigars or paint in Italian suits.\/ Having more time to work after your mate dumps you for someone younger.\/ Being included in revised versions of art history.\/ Not having to undergo the embarassment of being called a genius.\/ Getting your pictures in the art magazines wearing a gorilla suit.\/ Please send $ and comments to: Guerilla Girls Conscience of the Art World\/ Box 1056 Cooper Sta. NY, NY 10276.\"",
    "justification": "The Guerrilla Girls, founded in 1985, are a group of anonymous female graphic designers who combine substantive content with eye-catching graphics to present feminist viewpoints in a sly, ironic way. The Advantages of Being a Woman Artist is proposed for acquisition along with another Guerrilla Girls poster; the pair would be the first posters by this design group to enter the collection.",
