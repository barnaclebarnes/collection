    "justification": "This box, designed by Kolomon Moser and made by the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, is constructed of sheets of silver-plated brass. On the base are five stamped marks, which the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte saw as crucial representative symbols. Keeping with the concept of aesthetically significant marks for identification, the group designed several marks and individual designers and makers contributed their own. The first mark on the box is the Rose Mark, which was created by Josef Hoffman and is arguably the most commonly seen symbol on Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte silver. The second mark is the \u201cWW\u201d monogram in an oval (used from 1903\u201305), which identifies the piece as being produced within the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte. The third and fourth marks are for Moser and incorporate his initials in different arrangements and shaped shields. The fifth mark, the letter \u201cT\u201d enclosed in a larger \u201cQ,\u201d is likely the maker\u2019s mark of the craftsman who executed the work. The inclusion of this last mark is significant, as it demonstrates the importance the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte placed on design and execution over material value; the same amount of energy was expended in the design and execution for both silver-plated and solid silver pieces. This box has all the same marks a silver piece would have had, except for the silver standard mark.\nMoser, an Austrian designer and painter, was one of the leading figures of early 20th-century design. He worked in a variety of media, including glass, silver, and textiles, and designed works ranging from postage stamps to stained glass. Moser was one of the founders of the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte in 1903 but left the group in 1907 to focus on his own work. Though his time at the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte was brief, he made a great impact on the group. The famous Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte monogram is attributed to Moser\u2014the typographic treatment of which shows similarities to the mark created and used for the British Arts and Crafts movement by the Scottish designer, Charles Rennie Mackintosh.\nThe Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte and its major designers, as well as Viennese designers of the early 20th century, are significant in the history of design. At the time of proposed acquisition, the museum\u2019s decorative and applied arts holdings in this area include glass objects by Josef Hoffman and the Elephant Table by Adolf Loos. The museum holds graphic and textile designs by Moser, but this box would be the first example of Moser\u2019s object design in the museum\u2019s collection. The box\u2019s decorative treatment has a strong affinity with Moser\u2019s Die Quelle wall decorations in the collection, which adds to our understanding of the cross-fertilization of his designs. This fine piece is a wonderful addition to the museum\u2019s collection of metalwork and influential design from the early 20th century.",
    "gallery_text": "Austrian designer and painter Koloman Moser co-founded the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte in 1903, a group dedicated to bridging the gap between fine art and handicraft. Moser left in 1907 over financial and creative disagreements. Nonetheless, his focus on geometric, functional shapes, basic construction, and simple decoration\u2014as seen on this silver-plated brass box\u2014had a lasting influence, and set new aesthetic standards for the time. The five stamped marks on the box\u2019s base demonstrate the designer\u2019s interests in crediting all workmen involved in the creation of an object and in valuing design and craftsmanship over materials. Marks were not reserved for solid silver or other intrinsically expensive pieces; even silver-plated brass deserved the honor. Two Werkst\u00e4tte symbols on the base of the box, the registered Rose Mark and WW, two symbols with Moser\u2019s initials, and what is probably the metalworker\u2019s maker\u2019s mark (a \u2018T\u2019 enclosed in a \u2018Q\u2019) are displayed in a single row, evenly spaced and of comparable sizes, signifying the equal importance of both designer and craftsman.",
