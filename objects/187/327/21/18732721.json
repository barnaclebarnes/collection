    "justification": "Woven textiles made from paper originated in 16th century Japan, where these paper cloths (shifu in Japanese) were most likely developed by the impoverished rural population for lack of other materials. With few raw materials available, farmers originally cut the pages of ancient account books in order to turn them into shifu weaves. The ink writing on the paper also remained visible on the finished fabric, leaving an interesting speckled pattern. Soon, this cloth attained a more prominent place in society as samurai refined the technique by means of sophisticated and elaborate folding, cutting, and spinning processes, in which the finest threads could be manufactured and woven into noble cloths. These paper weaves were often used for ceremonial clothes and, in order to express their spirituality, samurai wrote prayers on the paper before turning it into yarns and cloth. \nThis particular example of shifu is an ase-hajiki, or sweat-protector. It is a type of paper undergarment worn during the summer to keep the wearer cooler in the heat. Because the paper layer was closest to the skin it provided space for air to circulate between the skin and outer garment. More common than items made of paper cloth are similar undergarments made from bamboo, which are ultimately more durable than paper. \nShifu is an example of an eco-friendly textile because of the ways in which it recycles materials to create an end product of greater value.",
