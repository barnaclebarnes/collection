    "gallery_text": "Created for the 1977 UK release of the American film \u201cThe Stepford Wives,\u201d this poster of the same name draws on ideas of female independence and individuality.  In the film, women from the town of Stepford are replaced by beautiful but threatening cyborgs. The poster imitates the film\u2019s content; a woman appears to crumble, her delicate body depicted in jagged edges that resemble broken porcelain.",

Rather than depict an actual scene from the film, the designer chose to represent its inner psychology.",
