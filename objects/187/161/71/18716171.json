    "description": "Narrow vertical hanging with softly undulating vertical ruffles of felted white wool and silk.",
    "justification": "Ursula Suter began experimenting with felt in 1997 and undertook a more serious study of the technique at the Ballenberg Museum Course Center in Switzerland (2002\u201304). Her first solo exhibition, Felt Skins, was held in 2002 in Z\u00fcrich. She has participated in numerous group shows in Europe and has been an annual participant in the International Felt Symposium. \nSuter begins with gossamer sheets of wool batting. With a needle and thread, she gently pleats, tucks, or ruches the fiber into folds. Each fold must be covered in plastic to prevent it from felting to the background. When she proceeds to the wetting and agitation stage, which together cause felting, the folds are transformed into standing ridges and rippling surface textures. The aforementioned technique is unique to this artist.\nEnhancing the Textile department\u2019s collection of felt is a priority, and Structures and Surfaces is of particular interest to the museum\u2019s collection because it combines felt-making and dressmaking techniques, particularly pleating. This type of hand-manipulation has a strong and diverse representation in the collection, in everything from 19th-century whitework embroidery with smocking and pin-tucks to Issey Miyake's heat-pleated polyesters from the 1990s.",
    "gallery_text": "The concepts of dye-resist patterning have been applied to felt-making, using the resist medium to prevent the wool from shrinking in specific areas rather than resisting color. This is sometimes called shibori felting, for the traditional Japanese tie-dye method, but is also related to West African plangi, or stitched-resist. \nUrsula Suter combines the amorphous and unpredictable nature of felt-making with the fastidiousness of dressmaking. She begins with a gossamer sheet of wool batting. With a needle and thread, she gently pleats it into a series of parallel folds. Each fold is covered with a thin plastic strip and lightly stitched in place. When she proceeds to the wetting and agitation which cause felting, no area is spared from shrinkage, but the folded area inside the plastic strip felts only to itself, not to the background. When the felting is complete, the ridges stand off the surface in a variety of undulating organic forms.",

She gently pleats gossamer sheets of wool batting into folds, hand-stitching a strip of plastic over each fold to prevent it from felting to the background.
