    "description": "Triangular cut-out shapes in gelatin-infused cream felt chair structure that repeats the triangular form and is based on the shape of a crumpled used handkerchief.",
    "justification": "The Bless You chair is a one-off production designed by Louise Campbell that combines technical felt making and an understanding of structure with a personal approach to form. The form, inspired by a crumpled handkerchief, is achieved by suspending a single sheet of gelatin-soaked felt from a carefully plotted group of strings. \nDescribing her design inspiration, Campbell says, \u201cMy cold fingers take out the fine pocket handkerchief. I manage to give the newly ironed square an admiring glance before putting it to work on my November sneeze. Now crumpled, it is returned to my overcoat pocket with a brand new texture. Three sniffly months later I have fumbled my way to this easy chair.\u201d\nThe chair\u2019s shape suggests both the source of its inspiration as well as its intended function, the latter dependent on a firmness imparted by the compressed dried gelatin. The cut-outs add a playful and visual lightness while keeping the weight of the arms from becoming a structural liability. This design and its use of cut felt served as a prototype for Campbell\u2019s Prince chair, designed in 2001 for an invitational competition for the Crown Prince of Denmark. The Prince chair incorporates cut-outs and felt but relies on water-jet cutting and lamination to a rubber substrate for its production. \nCampbell, the daughter of a Danish father and an English mother, was raised and educated in both countries. After receiving her degree from the London College of Furniture in 1992, she returned to Denmark to further her studies in industrial design at the Danish Design School, graduating in 1995. In 1996, she set up her own studio, focusing on furniture and lighting design with increasing involvement in other product and interior design projects. \nThe Bless You chair represents a creative and innovative use of felt, an important medium within the museum\u2019s textiles collection. The chair also enhances the collection\u2019s focus on prototypes\u2014in this case, as a finished unique chair that stands not only as an important design object in its own right but also as a key component in the chronology of this innovative designer.",
