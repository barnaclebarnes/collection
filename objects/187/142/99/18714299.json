    "gallery_text": "This up-curved form composed of joined stainless-steel segments can expand or contract into a square or rectangle. Inspired by vintage lift gates, this bowl, like many Campana Brothers designs, is infused with the spirit of Brazil and, in particular, S\u00e3o Paolo, where they were born. The words transformation and reinvention best describe their work. Their attention to materials is the cornerstone of their design process; they often incorporate common substances into their designs, ever combining low and high design. This object exudes all of these characteristics: the joined steel elements with a circular diamond chip mounted at one corner.",
    "label_text": "Inspired by a flexing pantographic elevator door, the Brazilian brothers Fernando and Humberto Campana designed this bowl with jointed elements that can expand or contract to vary the size and shape. The bowl is one of several examples of how the Campanas are influenced by their surroundings.",
