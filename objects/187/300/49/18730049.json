    "description": "Asymmetrical arrangement of motifs, with central landscape view of a peacock perched on a balustrade under an arbor. This view is surrounded by other motifs include ceramic vases, potted plants and rondelle with interior view. Printed in metallic gold, red, black, brown and blue on an ocher ground.",
    "justification": "This Anglo-Japanesque-style wallpaper is distinguished by the variety of asymmetrically arranged elements. The large central landscape with a peacock and urns under an arbor is surrounded by geometric frames that contain either urns or potted plants against a crackle background and stylized floral motifs. One circular ornament directly below the landscape contains an interior view. \nThe design of this work is modeled after other papers from the same period, most notably the Brooklyn Bridge paper in the museum\u2019s collection, which creates alternating columns of vases and landscapes when seen in repeat. Some liberties were taken with the original formula by the addition of a second column of vases. When taken in context, this paper probably would have been the sidewall used in a tripartite wall decoration which consisted of a dado, sidewall, and frieze combination. The highly detailed ornaments and copious use of metallic gold pigment would have created a richly illustrated background for all the accoutrements of an Aesthetic interior.\nThe pattern is very representative of the late 19th century and its design ideals and would make a fine contextual complement when displayed with Aesthetic period furniture and objects from the museum\u2019s collection.",
