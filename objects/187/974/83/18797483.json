    "description": "Study of grassy landscape with ruins of colonnade in mid-ground, looking to mountainous landscape, that is possibly separated by a body of water and shoreline.  A small stand of dark, pyramidal trees is to the right of two single, free-standing columns.  The columns are in the Corinthian order and likely date from Roman settlement.",
    "justification": "In the winter of 1877\u201378, Lockwood de Forest returned to Greece and Egypt. It was during this trip that he painted this study of columns. This little landscape shows de Forest\u2019s appreciation of ancient ruins, which was inspired by Frederic Edwin Church\u2019s teachings as well as Church\u2019s sketches of Greek and Roman sites. The work also shows de Forest\u2019s hand becoming looser and somewhat more tonal, which is characteristic of his personal style.",
