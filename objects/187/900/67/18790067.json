    "justification": "Although he was perhaps better known as an architect and furniture designer, Josef Frank also designed more than 200 textiles between 1909 and 1950. He was familiar with the business from an early age: his father, Ignaz Frank, was a partner in a large textile production firm and his mother was a highly skilled embroiderer whose work was shown at the 1925 Exposition des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris. Frank produced his first textile design while still studying architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna. \nFrank\u2019s interest in pattern design was not unique among Viennese architects; like Josef Hoffmann, Koloman Moser, Otto Czeschka, and Dagobert Peche, he produced several early designs for the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte. Unlike other Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte designers who created a unified design scheme by using the same pattern throughout an interior\u2014on textiles, wallcoverings, and even fashion\u2014Frank preferred an eclectic combination of fabrics in his interiors. With Oskar Wlach, he opened a retail shop, Haus & Garten, which offered furniture, textiles, rugs, and interior design services. Wlach ran the business side and Frank served as principal designer. \nAmid rising anti-Semitism in Austria, in 1933 Frank accepted an offer from Estrid Ericson to work as chief designer for the Swedish interior design firm Svenkst Tenn, and moved with his family to Sweden. By the late 1930s, his work with the firm was closely associated with Swedish modern design, in particular his light, unpretentious cotton prints strongly influenced by Indian chintz fabrics, botanical drawings, and field guides. \nBows was produced in 1960 after an early design for a carpet for Haus & Garten from 1929. Unlike his designs for printed fabrics, which were entirely inspired by nature, Frank\u2019s carpet designs were based on paving patterns and other abstract geometrics. The design itself is in the Backhausen archives in Vienna, and the carpet, produced by Almadahl\u2019s, was featured in an interior in Innen-Dekoration in 1933. The design still feels fresh and modern, with its field of activated geometric forms and brilliant colors. \nThis would be the second example of Frank\u2019s work to enter the museum\u2019s collection, joining one of his printed textiles from the 1930s with delicate botanicals on a white ground.",
