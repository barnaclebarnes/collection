    "description": "Scenic wallpaper designed for a bathroom. This mural is composed of three different panels making up one underwater scene. Section I, the first of three panels, contains two large fish with striped heads swimming. Two clams rest on the hilly bottom. Plant life is growing up both sides of the scene.  The three panels work in sequence, with the right edge of Section III joining up the left edge of Section I. This one scene would then repeat around your bathroom.  Printed in colors on an off-white ground.",
    "justification": "This charming and unusual mural, Sea Beauties (1920\u201340), is intended for use in a bathroom or washroom. Composed of three sections, the panels are lithographs printed for a very smooth, almost watercolor-like appearance. \nWe do have other scenic murals printed by lithograph in the collection, but nothing of this scale for bathrooms. At the time of proposed acquisition, in related genres, we have a sanitary paper designed by Christopher Dresser, bathroom papers designed by Edward Bawden, and vinyl papers produced during the 1960s and 1970s that could be used in washrooms as well. This mural would be a strong addition to both the scenic wallpaper and the sanitary paper holdings.",
    "gallery_text": "Scenic wallpaper designed for your bathroom. Called Sea Beauties, lithograph printed in Germany around 1930. The lithograph printing gives it a very soft look, almost like a watercolor, and because it is printed with oils is water resistant. Washable wallpapers as we know them today were not developed until 1934 and lithograph prints were one of the early wipeable papers. Composed of three panels, each 40 inches wide by over five feet high. The printing on the third panel lines up with the first so this underwater scene could continue uninterrupted around your bathroom. This is a very novel idea which would transform your bathing experience.",
