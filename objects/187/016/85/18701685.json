    "description": "Curving rectangular seat having low, slightly upturned back with angled sides and large central opening; constructed of long laminated strips of Brazilian hardwoods in tones of dark to medium brown; mounted on black, slim cylindrical metal frame with four splayed legs.",
    "justification": "The son of a furniture maker, Joaquim Tenreiro learned traditional wood crafting and joinery techniques in his father\u2019s workshop but became known for breaking with tradition by developing a contemporary formal Brazilian language of design that utilized native materials. \nTenreiro was born in Portugal but made Brazil his home. In 1928, he married and settled in Rio de Janeiro, where he began making furniture in traditional styles for firms such as Laubisch-Hirth. Tenreiro was also one of the founding members of the Bernardelli Group, formed in 1931 at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes. The Bernadelli Group wanted to raise the status of art as a profession. They broke with entrenched academic conservatism and championed a modernism that combined international art movements, such as cubism and expressionism, with Brazilian social issues and imagery derived from the Brazilian landscape and indigenous peoples.\nBy the late 1920s and early 1930s, a greater interest in modern design and interiors was also developing in Brazil, partly due to exhibitions such as a show of works by artists of the \u00c9cole de Paris that took place in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo\u2014the first time the Brazilian public saw first-hand a collection of work by some of the great European modern artists. Influential images and books showing the work of architects and designers such as Le Corbusier gained wider circulation. Sociopolitical events, such as the revolution of 1930, led to greater state support of the arts.\nThe late 1930s and early 1940s were seminal years for Tenreiro. During that time, he designed furniture for not only Laubisch-Hirth, but for Leandro Martins and Francisco Gomes as well. In 1941, he received a commission to create furniture for a home designed by Oscar Niemeyer for the writer Francisco In\u00e1cio Peixoto, one of many collaborations with the Brazilian architect.\nIn 1942, Tenreiro broke completely with tradition and created his first chair in the modern style, advocating an idea that Brazilian furniture should express a contemporary formal language. It should be free of excessive ornamentation and designed with the Brazilian climate and way of living in mind, using native hard woods and other materials, such as wicker. Tenreiro\u2019s pieces were constructed by Brazilian woodworkers familiar with native woods and traditional working techniques. During this period, he and a business partner opened their own furniture business, Langenbach and Tenreiro Ltda., in Rio, expanding to a second location in S\u00e3o Paulo to meet the demand for his designs. He continued designing furniture until the late 1960s, when he closed the business to devote himself to painting and sculpture.\nThis stool (ca. 1955\u201360) rests on a on a four-legged iron base. The seat is constructed of solid strips of different woods tightly fixed together. This technique was first seen in a Tenreiro\u2019s tripod chair (1947), considered by some to be his signature work. Here, three different kinds of wood with differing characteristics and differing expansion and contraction rates must be cured and joined so they will not split; this involves a technically-demanding process. The simplicity of the squared form is accentuated by the opening defining the seat and low back support, as well as the linear strips in varied shades of warm brown.\nThere is a growing awareness that Brazilian modern design has been overlooked and is due for recognition.\nReferences: \nMaria Cecilia Loschiavo dos Santos, M\u00f3vel Moderno no Brasil (Editoria do Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo: S\u00e3o Paulo, 1995), 82\u201391.\n\u201cJoaquim Tenreiro, April 4\u2013July 12, 1998,\u201d Museu de Arte Contempor\u00e2nea de Niter\u00f3i, Brazil, http:\/\/macniteroi.com\/expoanteriores\/joaquimtenreiro\/joaquimtenreiro.htm [English translation]\n\u201cJoaquim Tenreiro,\u201d The Embassy of Brazil in London, http:\/\/www.brazil.org.uk\/page.php?cid=994",
