    "justification": "Work by the pioneering American industrial and furniture designer, Gilbert Rohde, is notable for its thoroughly modern, informal, and multifunctional qualities. Rohde\u2019s ability to create appealing modernist furnishings for middle-class homes, while also devising merchandising strategies to sell these goods, places him within a unique framework in American design history. Rohde\u2019s visit to Europe in the spring and summer of 1927 (with later trips in 1931 and 1937) to see the Bauhaus in Dessau and the French modernist design that debuted in the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris, profoundly inspired his concept of design and the role it should play in daily life. The French art deco and German rationalist styles he saw in Europe influenced the furniture he designed from the late 1920s into the 1940s\u2014pieces he created to suit the rapidly changing American lifestyle. \nIn addition to his renowned work for Herman Miller Inc., Rohde also designed for several other furniture firms, including Thonet, Troy Sunshade, and Heywood-Wakefield. What set Rohde apart from his contemporaries was his all-encompassing understanding of the furniture industry, from design and production to marketing and showroom display.[1] During his time with Herman Miller Inc. (1932\u201344), Rohde set the standard for collaborative efforts between designers and furniture firms, with George Nelson and Charles and Ray Eames later following in his footsteps. In 1944, Rohde was killed in an automobile accident. Herman Miller produced his designs posthumously until 1946. \nThis model 3626 vanity is a Rohde design from 1936, which was introduced about 1937. Constructed of planar wood and glass components, its sleek rectilinear form exemplifies modernist simplicity and function and is balanced by warmth from the two tones of wood employed in the cabinetry. This vanity was originally part of a six-piece bedroom set (vanity, two bedside tables, two dressers, and a headboard), purchased new in 1944. This mass-produced vanity\u2019s combination of beauty and utility achieved Rohde\u2019s aim of creating furniture for a modern, flexible lifestyle that came to represent American society in the postwar years.\nRohde\u2019s archives (1930\u201344) are held by the museum. This piece would be the second example of furniture by this significant American designer to enter the museum\u2019s collection, joining a Troy Sunshade tubular metal stool from about the same period.\n[1]Phyllis Ross, Gilbert Rohde: Modern Design for Modern Living (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009).",
    "gallery_text": "Gilbert Rohde, who worked for Herman Miller from 1932 until his death in 1944, began a movement for collaboration between designers and manufacturers on design, marketing, and advertising, which would characterize much of midcentury production. Before taking what the company perceived as a \u201cgamble\u201d on Rohde, Herman Miller made historical reproduction pieces based on pattern books, and was nearing bankruptcy. With a simple Rohde design, 1932 marked the company\u2019s first foray into modern furniture by a young designer, which proved to be a great success. This vanity, designed in 1936 and introduced c. 1937, exemplifies the simplicity, sleekness, and machine-made qualities of Rohde\u2019s work. The glass top was a popular feature of vanity tables throughout the 1930s and 40s. It protected the wood from perfumes and cosmetics and, when objects were placed on it, created the visual drama that they were floating above the surface. The vanity was part of a six-piece bedroom set, a custom that began in the late 19th century. Before then the vanity or dressing table was made and sold as a separate piece of furniture. Consumers could purchase as many or as few pieces as their space and budgetary constraints would allow--typical of the light and modular furniture he promoted. Rohde would design more than 350 pieces for Herman Miller, helping lead the name to become synonymous with midcentury modern design.",
