    "justification": "In 1983, Jhane Barnes became the first fashion designer to collaborate with Knoll. Barnes was known for the innovative fabrics she designed for her own menswear line. For her first capsule collection of upholstery fabrics for Knoll, she modified and tightened the weave of some of her sport coat fabrics, employing space-dyed yarns for tonal vitality. Nuance is from this collection.\nBarnes continued to design menswear but also worked prolifically for Knoll from 1983 to 1997, during which time she created 16 collections. With her fashion background, she introduced Knoll to new mills. This lead to pioneering work with Japanese mills that initiated Knoll\u2019s move toward high-tech fabrics. \nNuance would enhance the museum\u2019s collection of textiles and wallpapers by Barnes. At the time of proposed acquisiton, the collection includes another colorway of this design.",
