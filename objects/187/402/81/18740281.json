    "justification": "The chair models Ward Bennett designed for the Geiger furniture company belong to a group introduced in 1991 were titled Charpentiers after the skilled artisans who were part of the compagnonnage movement in France (making these pieces the spiritual and aesthetic descendants of the staircase models in the museum\u2019s collection, some of which were created by the charpentiers guild of the compagnonnage.)\nThe furniture Bennett designed for Geiger shows the use of simplified line and bold geometries consistent with his work in other media. His design process for furniture appears to rely heavily on models. Two chair models give the dimensions of the full-size chair and cushion on the base of the seat. Another indicates possible alternatives of textile or wood back. \nAt the time, the Geiger pieces were described as the largest single design statement of Bennett's six-decade career, having taken nearly three years to design and produce after travel and continuous investigations of French architecture and design along with conversations with modern-day charpentiers. These experiences led Bennett to design high quality, durable furniture that could be industrially produced, and with an aesthetic of its era, yet timeless. The models represent the Boull\u00e9e, Ledoux, Nettuno (variant), and Paladio (spelled with one \u201cl\u201d) chairs.\nThese chair models are proposed for acquisition along with a selection of Bennett\u2019s prototype models for ceramic forms and design and production process drawings for flatware. The design process materials under consideration would expand our understanding and collection of Bennett\u2019s work. In addition, acquisitions involving material in one department that support holdings in other departments contribute to the strength of our permanent holdings.",
