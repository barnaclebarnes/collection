    "description": "White form of moveable folding elements. Closed position: tight cylinder of 12 legs each hinged at joint with seat element, in turn hinged at top to small circle with inset handle. Form furls out into circular seat composed of 12 wedges spiraling out from central circle with handle; each wedge with hinged leg twisting down into a central shaft, then flaring out to form stable, 12-footed base. Nylon surfaces shows lines and marks of layering from laser syntering process.",
    "justification": "The One__Shot.MGX folding stool is a highly functional form, designed to be manufactured by rapid prototyping technology, a revolutionary digital three-dimensional printing process. In 2008, rapid prototyping is still a relatively new technology, most often employed to produce medical devices or industrial items such as car parts. The French industrial and interior designer, Patrick Jouin, and the Belgian manufacturer, Materialise NV, were among the first to explore this nascent technology for production of furniture, lighting, and products for the domestic landscape. The digital technology allows designers (and will eventually allow consumers) the freedom to create a variety of forms that can be customized and produced as limited editions or unique works, and presents an alternative to traditional mass production methods that rely on standardization to achieve ease of manufacture and low cost to the consumer. \nThis stool is a single unit of hinged and twisting parts, but it is not made by conventional manufacture and assembly. Its name is derived from the fact that it is made all at once\u2014in one shot. Jouin\u2019s design is rendered in a three-dimensional computer image that is sliced horizontally and then \u201cprinted,\u201d layer-by-layer, hinges and all, via laser sintering, an additive manufacturing method that uses a powerful laser to fuse powdered material, in this case polyamide (nylon), into a three-dimensional object. Contact between the laser beam and the nylon hardens the material to produce the object. The laser selectively fuses the nylon by scanning cross-sections generated from the three-dimensional digital description (from a CAD file or scan data) on the surface of a powder bed. After each cross-section is scanned by the laser, the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top, and the process is repeated until the stool is complete.\nOne__Shot.MGX would be the museum\u2019s first example of an object manufactured using rapid prototyping technology.",
