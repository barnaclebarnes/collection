    "description": "Panoramic paper depicting the coast of Villefranche in southeast France. The paper contains scenes of the harbor with ships, architectural ruins, figures, cows, goats and sheep. Printed in 8 warm shades of tan. A full set of 14 panels. \"La Cote\" requires 157 wood blocks to print in this colorway.",
    "justification": "La C\u00f4te de Villefranche is a beautiful example of a 20th-century scenic wallpaper. La C\u00f4te continues the theme of early 19th-century scenic papers by showing villagers at work and at play in front of a majestic harbor. It depicts fishing boats, tall ships, and ancient ruins, which were also present in Views of Italy, printed 100 years earlier. This scenic was printed with a relatively small number of wood blocks and the height of the imagery is quite low. \nThe Colonial Revival period sparked resurgence in the use of scenic wallpapers. While most interior designers advocated the use of antique scenics, many people could not afford this luxury. Numerous manufacturers saw the need for less expensive scenic papers and began producing designs in both historic and modern styles. This trend lasted into the 1960s, reaching its peak in the late 1950s.\nDesigned in 1929, this set was printed in 1930. The gift proposed for acquisition comprises a full unused set of 14 panels. At the time of proposed acquisition, the museum has two other sets of scenic papers designed and produced in the 20th century. Arcadia (ca. 1928) was block printed by the Robert Graves Company and shows a classic landscape. Scenic Hudson (1930\u201340) is a lithograph printed by the Schmitz-Horning Company and captures a romanticized view of the Hudson River. The museum owns two other sets of scenic papers produced by Zuber et Cie, including El Dorado (1849) and Le Paysage a Chasse (1831). We also have the scene of Niagara Falls and the Natural Bridge of Virginia from the Views of North America (1834\u201336). Scenic papers produced by other companies in the museum\u2019s collection include Dufour\u2019s Cupid and Psyche (1816) and Views of Italy (1822). Considering the demand for scenic wallpapers during the early to mid-20th century, La C\u00f4te de Villefranche will help build the museum\u2019s collection of these popular papers.",
