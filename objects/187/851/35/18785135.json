    "justification": "Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec\u2019s design for the Osso chair was conceived with its manufacturer in mind.  Mattiazzi, a family owned and operated company based in Udine, Italy, is known for its sophisticated use of cutting edge technology and its commitment to local manufacturing.  Using an eight-axis CNC milling machine, Mattiazzi produces wooden furniture in complex shapes that were once reserved for injection-molded plastic. Mattiazzi uses wood carefully selected and sourced from the surrounding region.  Environmentally conscious, their manufacturing equipment is powered by solar energy.  \n \nOsso, the Italian word for bone, alludes to the Bouroullec brothers\u2019 desire to create a family of furniture whose material is what gives the structure strength but also to the physical inspiration for its form.  The \u201cassembling system of wooden panels allows a quite singular strength while preserving a design balance of the objects.\u201d  As the Bouroullecs have noted, \u201cthe quality of the wood literally makes the object.\u201d  The Osso chair design highlights the \u201csensuality\u201d of the wood.  The wood\u2019s smooth, polished surface, which is not chemically treated, invites touch and allows the material, be it oak, maple or ash, to \u201cexpress itself.\u201d\n \nThis drawing, which was executed in the early months of 2011 by the Bouroullecs, was done after the Osso chair had already gone into development with Mattiazzi.  Inspired by the successful form and production, the designers took the opportunity for a \u201cmoment of reflection\u201d to consider how the Osso design might grow into a larger collection of furniture.  The drawing illustrates the Osso chair in both child and adult size, as an armchair, and finally as a stool.  The use of a purple felt pen brush to execute the designs on the sheet was a conscious one, though not evocative of a particular produced wood or stain. The brothers have written, \u201cFelt pen allows [the] drawing of shapes not by contours but through masses of colour.\u201d As \u201copposed to thin lines that can be used to define forms by structure and perimeter...the ink spreads on the paper in a generous, bold and massive way, producing shapes [through] concentric lines, stain by stain.\u201d",
