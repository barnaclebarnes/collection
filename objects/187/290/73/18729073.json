    "description": "Circular drawing showing the interior of a great basilica, identified as St. Peter's in Rome by an inscription below the image. The view looks down the barrel vaulted nave toward the altar in the distance at left. Small figures are placed in the middle distance and foreground.",
    "justification": "This drawing is typical of scenes of notable monuments in Rome that were created for the tourist trade in the mid-18th century. Drawings of this kind, presumably after a published print, were usually produced by students or members of an artist\u2019s workshop as preparatory exercises to further their understanding of perspective, proportion, and scale. \nThis drawing would add to drawings already in the museum\u2019s collection that show other interior views of the Basilica of St. Peter\u2019s in Rome. As an aid to study for students in the Cooper-Hewitt\/Parsons master\u2019s degree program, it will prove to be an invaluable example of the relationship between prints and drawings of architecture and will provide insight on pedagogical training in the 18th century among French students studying in Rome.",
