    "justification": "Personal transistor radios were first developed in the 1950s but, due to high cost, were not universally popular until the 1960s when inexpensive imports and popularization of the technology brought down the price. As of 2008, the transistor radio remained the single most popular communications device worldwide, with some estimates suggesting that there are at least seven billion in existence.\nThe Moosk radio recalls Isamu Noguchi\u2019s Radio Nurse (1937) as it, too, resembles a mask with its mouth-like speaker. In 1996, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Olivet designed this sculptural radio under Philippe Starck\u2019s direction and, two years later, Thomson Consumer put Moosk into production for Alessi. Moosk is compatible with Starck\u2019s Faitoo hook system and, alternatively, it may attach directly to the wall with mounting hooks.",
    "gallery_text": "Starck\u2019s biomorphic Moosk radio is an example of the drastic move away from angular shapes that typified much of modernism. The soft, ovoid edges and contoured surface of the radio\u2019s plastic casing produce a nuanced, abstracted face-like shape. Resembling a mask with its mouth-like speaker, the radio recalls Isamu Nogushi\u2019s Radio Nurse from 1937. Personal transistor radios were first developed in the 1950s but became more popular and inexpensive over time. In fact, as of 2008, personal transistor radios were the single most popular communications device worldwide.",
