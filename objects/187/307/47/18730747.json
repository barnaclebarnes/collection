The background is composed of a grid pattern. Printed in black, gray and taupe on a white ground. The first of seven identical panels.",
    "justification": "Marcel Wanders is among the most prolific early 21st-century Dutch designers. His work ranges from porcelain vases, furniture, and lighting, to textiles, wallpaper, and hotel interiors. His first foray into wallpaper design culminated in the Hexagon series (2004). \nThe striking hexagonal form of each piece allows a considerable degree of installation flexibility because each panel can be rotated as desired to create a more random repeat. The decorative design is screen printed in six colors, giving the paper a sense of depth while the intricate lace-like patterns and layering keeps the viewer\u2019s eyes moving around the dynamic design. It\u2019s overall decoration is characteristic of Wanders\u2019s current work; Hexagon\u2019s shape, combined with the variegated patterning, creates a quilted effect when installed. The paper is available in four colorways: black, red, yellow, and brown.\nThis would be the first example of hexagonally-shaped wallpaper in the museum\u2019s collection.",
