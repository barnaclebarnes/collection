    "justification": "William Arthur Smith Benson was a leader of the British Arts and Crafts movement. Although he trained as an architect, Benson took up metalwork at the suggestion of Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. Benson\u2019s light fittings became models for other Arts and Crafts metalwork\u00ac\u2014innovative lighting designs for both candles and electric light. \nEarly in his career, Benson focused predominantly on handcrafted objects and candle lighting. In 1881, he hired the brass and copper worker, John Lovegrove, who contributed great experience and skill and with whom Benson collaborated for many years. Benson\u2019s workshop succeeded in mixing hand and machine production by maintaining an honesty of construction and a high quality of workmanship and design. \nBenson was also an active advocate for his field. He became a founding member the Art Workers\u2019 Guild in 1884, which brought together progressive architects, designers, and craftsmen, and also helped to establish the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887 to address the lack of exhibitions for decorative art in Britain. \nBenson\u2019s use of modern machinery and his passion for the handmade Arts and Crafts approach is evident in this design. The decorative style of the copper and brass decoration forming plant leaves and the use of opalescent glass for the globe show Benson\u2019s continued interest in artistry and new technology. Many of Benson\u2019s electric lamp designs are based on an assembly of standard parts used in different ways depending on the function, which demonstrates his fascination with machinery in both design and production. \nInitially, the introduction of electric lighting into British society was limited to the upper classes. By the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, however, cheaper and more reliable electrical distribution brought electricity to a broader range of society. As a noteworthy engineer and innovative designer, Benson\u2019s electric lamps were held in high esteem by both upper- and middle-class consumers.",
