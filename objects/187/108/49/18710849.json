    "description": "Interior of Basilica of St. Peter's on Holy Thursday.  View is asymmetrical, from a position between the left side aisle and the nave.  Interior is illuminated by a large cross, composed of several hundred lit oil lamps, suspended in front of the Bernini baldichin.  Figures stand under the cross and scattered around the nave.",
    "justification": "This drawing depicts the display of the large illuminated cross in the nave of Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica during Holy Week. \nFrancesco Panini was the younger son of the painter Giovanni Paolo Panini. The elder son, Guiseppe, was an architect who is noted for his work on the Trevi Fountain. Francesco trained in his father\u2019s workshop and specialized in making preparatory drawings for etchings of architectural subjects. For printmaking, he worked with engravers including Domenico Montag\u00f9, Giuseppe Vasi, Francesco Polanzani, Domenico Cigni, Giovanni Ottaviani, and Giovanni Volpato. \nWhile Panini\u2019s representation of this scene is less dramatic than that rendered by Louis-Jean Desprez, also proposed for acquisition, it is more carefully drawn. The two sheets, as an ensemble, would make a wonderful comparison for anyone working on Roman views by Piranesi and his contemporaries.",
