    "description": "Panel of industrially-produced felt dyed using a stitch resist technique. Felt is pleated, sewn together and dipped in a reactive textile dye. Felt filters the dye to create different shades and intensities of color.",
    "justification": "In Fluid Green, the Danish textile designer Inge Lindqvist explores her interest in traditional stitched-resist dyeing techniques through the industrial felt medium. Primarily used in Africa, Indonesia, Japan, South America, and Central Asia, the basic technique involves stitching areas before immersion dyeing to prevent penetration of the color into the stitched areas. In Lindqvist\u2019s interpretation, she uses a highly absorbent industrial felt that is folded, pleated, and stitched vertically before being immersed in a dye. Only about half the felt is immersed at one time, after which the piece is turned upside down to dye the other half. The \u201cwater-line\u201d is depicted by the whiter areas on the felt.  \nLindqvist is one of the most important designers working with felt in Denmark. Educated at both the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam and Danmarks Designskole in Copenhagen, Lindqvist has primarily exhibited her work in Copenhagen. Fluid Green is one of two works that she made for the exhibition, Light and Absence, at the Danish Museum of Art & Design (Kunstindustrimuseet) in Copenhagen in 1998. \nShe has been working with this medium exclusively since the late 1980s. The textile collection has several examples and variations of the technique used by Lindqvist.This particular piece is important because of the application of this dyeing technique to felt, an unusual choice given its thickness and relative lack of suppleness. The effect, however, is incredibly rich and gives both a solidity and fluidity that would have been impossible with another material.",
