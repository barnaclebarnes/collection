    "description": "Tall, yellow-tinted glass form with flat disc-like rim at mouth, long thin neck, and circular base; engraved wavy vertical lines cover form.",
    "justification": "Designed by the British designer and design theorist Christopher Dresser, this distinctively tall solifleur (a vase with a long, slender neck for displaying a single flower) Clutha vase is a major example of Dresser\u2019s work and a precursor to the art glass movement. \nThe name \u201cClutha\u201d is derived from an ancient name for the River Clyde, which runs through Glasgow. This vase relates to spiral decoration in Roman glass and is very transparent with a few bubbles that suggest an intentional reminder of its \u201cartistic\u201d nature. The piece is formally organized and has a proto-modern aspect. Its clarity connects directly to Dresser\u2019s earlier design writings, such as those from his Principles of Decorative Design (1873), in which he calls for rigid prescriptions for glass creation. Dresser was named in Studio magazine in 1899 as \u201cperhaps the greatest of commercial designers,\u201d so it is not surprising to find that Clutha glass was sold by Liberty in London in the 1890s, marked \u201cClutha\u201d in mock Celtic script, along with the lotus-flower trademark of Liberty and \u201cDesigned by C.D. Registered.\u201d \nAlthough Dresser\u2019s Clutha glass frequently displays irregular patterns in lighter and darker shades, this example shows his more regular combed and spiral pattern. With the various shapes and colors of Clutha glass, no two pieces are identical. Frequently characterized by attenuated necks with furled or wavy rims, Dresser\u2019s vases have been compared to his dissections of flowers. \nThe machine that enabled glass threads to be applied to the vessel was patented by William J. Hodgetts in 1876; Dresser\u2019s Clutha glass demonstrates the designer\u2019s delight in such inventions. Conceived in an antiquarian spirit but revealing novel techniques, colors, and textures, Clutha was commercially produced, providing an impetus for the production of much late 19th-century art glass. Clutha glass was a forerunner to an expanded interest in both the forms and techniques of European art glass, as well as Tiffany & Co.\u2019s Favrile glass. The acquisition of this piece would greatly advance the museum\u2019s understanding of the development of the arts movement in glass design.\nDresser is one of the most innovative and influential designers of the 19th century, and one who should be collected in depth. Cooper-Hewitt featured his work in a groundbreaking exhibition Shock of the Old: Christopher Dresser\u2019s Design Revolution, in 2004, which subsequently travelled to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Cooper-Hewitt has ceramics, furniture, wallcoverings, and metalwork designed by Dresser. The acquisition of this vase would be a valuable addition to the museum\u2019s collection of Dresser\u2019s work, both as a significant piece of glass and as the first example of a glass object designed by Dresser. The vase under consideration would also be the second example of the designer\u2019s later style of the 1890s, joining a sanitary wallpaper. This Clutha vase is an impressive display piece and one that is integral to the history of innovative design.",
