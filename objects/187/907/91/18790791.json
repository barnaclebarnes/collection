    "justification": "Knoll Wall is a sample book of the first group of woven wallcoverings produced by Knoll. The wallcoverings were developed by Merle Lindby-Young, then creative director of Knoll\u2019s textile division, and were introduced in the fall of 1984. The wallcoverings were designed to meet specific standards, such as ease of installation and a Class A fire rating. \nThe sample book contains a large swatch of each of the six different designs, along with smaller swatches to show additional colorways. The designs are a mix of subtle textures and solids. The fabric content varies by sample, but includes silk, linen, flax, rayon, polyester, and modacrylic. The use of modacrylic is significant because it is flame retardant and does not combust. It is also a highly durable fiber with a moderate resistance to abrasion. When modacrylics are mixed with natural fibers, they carry the look of the wool, linen or silk while meeting the stringent safety requirements of contract installations. \nThis sample book illustrates Knoll\u2019s early contribution to the field of wallcoverings. This significant book also relates to pieces in the museum\u2019s collection. Sample books are a particular strength of the museum\u2019s wallcoverings collection, and the addition of this book would continue to broaden our holdings and fortify interdepartmental connections.",
