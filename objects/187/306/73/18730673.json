    "justification": "In this preparatory drawing, filled with a variety of sketches, the industrial designer Gerald Gulotta explores the idea of twisting a knife\u2019s blade and handle and also explores the concept with several designs for forks. \nGulotta became an established freelance designer of ceramics, glassware, and cutlery during the 1960s and 70s. His sleek, slender, and elegant tabletop designs look as contemporary today as they did at the height of his career. \nAt the time of proposed acquisition, the museum hold sheets of Gulotta\u2019s designs for ceramics, glassware, and silver, many of which relate to three-dimensional objects in the museum\u2019s collection. While the museum holds examples of Gulotta flatware patterns (including Axis, Chromatics, Espa\u00f1a, Eros, Iona, and Rondure), this drawing, part of a larger group of drawings proposed for acquisition, would be among the first works on paper connected to Gulotta flatware in the museum\u2019s collection. Seen together with the related patterns in the collection, these drawings are invaluable documents for understanding Gulotta\u2019s working process for designing cutlery.",
