    "justification": "The Rocket, developed by Paillard S.A. and engineered by Giuseppe Prezioso, is a typewriter identified with Hermes, the Greek god of travel and commerce. The model was part of the company\u2019s portable line of Hermes typewriters (including the Hermes Baby and the Featherweight), which were the first truly small portable machines on the market. \nThe Rocket is an excellent example of precision engineering in a streamlined, functionalist form that predicted the shape of later modern typewriters, as seen in its low, clean, angular profile, and metal housing in cool colors: gray with a red stripe where the body meets the spool covers. Simple bold white and red lettering proclaims, \u201cHermes Rocket.\u201d\nRevolutionary for its small and light form, the Rocket was conceived as a practical compact machine for travel, able to fit in a briefcase. The overall size and weight were reduced by economical construction: the case itself strengthened the frame and the internal parts were regularized. Size could also be kept to a minimum by means of the machine\u2019s innovative method of printing capital letters by raising the carriage and roller instead of the typebars, so the typebars did not require extra space in the housing. Despite this change in mechanism, the keyboard and operation were the same as those of a standard machine. Inexpensive, portable, and reliable, the Rocket was a favorite of journalists and writers such as Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck.",
