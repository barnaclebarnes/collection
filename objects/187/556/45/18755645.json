    "description": "Malleable globular form with short base, the whole composed of milky-toned silicone string-like trailings; mounted on internal red plastic base housing light bulb and cord.",
    "justification": "The notable Italian architect and designer Gaetano Pesce has been designing furniture and other objects since the 1960s. A number of his works are considered icons of 20th-century design. He is particularly noted for his experimental forms in resin and other synthetics, which emphasize the creative process in fabricating functional designs in modern materials. \nPesce\u2019s Moss lamp exemplifies his approach to \u201cindustrialized non-conformity.\u201d He utilizes modern fabrication techniques associated with mass-production and combines those with contemporary materials to produce unique objects. To create the Moss lamp, supple silicone is poured and trailed to achieve a basic sphere\u2014but it is not a perfect form. The end result is dictated by the behavior of the material. The form encloses a single incandescent light source that casts a soft glow through the interstices and varied thicknesses of the translucent thread-like trailings of the silicone body. The textured surface also invites the user\u2019s touch and its surprisingly warm, soft, and malleable form evokes an emotional response.\nThe Moss lamp proposed for acquisition is a prototype.",
    "gallery_text": "This lamp exemplifies Pesce\u2019s use of industrial production techniques and materials to produce unique objects. Here, he pours silicone in thread-like trails to achieve a textured and translucent sphere that casts a soft glow through irregular gaps and varied thickness. The end result is dictated by the behavior of the material.",
