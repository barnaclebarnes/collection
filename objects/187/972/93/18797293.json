Screen dark when off; when on, screen shows colorful App (Application) widgets. Reverse: housing shows apple logo in center.",
    "justification": "The importance of Apple Computer Inc. to computer design and consumer electronics is well established in the history of personal computing and digital technology. Incorporated in 1977 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, Apple has been a design innovator for operating systems, hardware, and software. The company has always emphasized good design as an integral element of its business philosophy. Its products, including the Macintosh computer (1984), the iPod digital music and media player (2001), and the iPhone smart phone (2007), have changed the way we interact with digital devices and the world around us. \nThe iPad tablet computer was introduced in 2010. It is a rectangular, flat, slate-like form with a screen made of a resilient, fingerprint- and scratch-resistant glass. Its size and weight falls between a laptop computer and a smart phone. As such, it is a light, mobile form that can act as a platform for audio visual media such as books, periodicals, movies, music, games, mobile software applications (apps), and web content. Its portability is enhanced by a rechargeable battery capable of holding a charge for 10 hours. Environmental concern is also part of Apple\u2019s design sensibility; the iPad is made of recyclable materials such as arsenic-free glass and a mercury-free backlit display.\nThe sleek all-in-one unit does not require an external keyboard, stylus, or mouse. Like the iPhone and later iPod models, the iPad is controlled by a multi-touch display, requiring only the swipe of a bare finger. Previous tablet computers, commercially available since the late 1990s, required a pressure sensitive stylus. An innovative feature of the display is that it responds to sensors that adjust screen brightness relative to ambient light. Its motion sensors and built-in apps support screen rotation in four orientations, including upside-down. Screen images automatically switch between portrait and landscape mode to accommodate the user\u2019s posture or preference. Due to the intuitive multi-touch display, the iPad only has four physical switches: volume up, volume down, sleep\/wake (for saving energy), and a home button. The home button, in the form of a small dimple on one side of the screen, returns the user to the main menu. \nThe iPad was a tremendous commercial success. By early 2011, over 15 million iPads had been sold, more than all other previous tablet computers combined.\nApple\u2019s innovative products enhance the museum\u2019s industrial design collection. The iPad tablet computer represents significant advances in design that effectively changed consumer expectations, habits, and lifestyle.",
