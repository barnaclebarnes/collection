The card is mounted with a lace-like sample entitled \"Plauen, or burnt-out Lace\" from Forbes & Wallace, a well-known department store. Plauen refers to the town of Plauen, Germany, a locale known for the manufacture of machine-made lace, in particular, \"burnout\" or chemical lace. The lace produced using this process required an embroidery machine, often times the Schiffli machine, to produce an embroidered design on a cotton or net substrate. Afterwards, chemicals or caustic soda were applied to \"burn away\" the substrate leaving behind an open, lace-like fabric that could be used for curtain panels as well as other decorative and domestic purposes.",
