    "description": "Vertical stripes of shiny white and gold viscose fibers held in a stainless steel mesh, alternating bands of warp conventionally bound with bands where the warp is permitted to drift.",
    "justification": "Longitude is an open structure made with stainless steel yarns, which can change radically in appearance from day to night, depending on the amount of light traveling through or being reflected off the surface. The meandering warp in its transparent structure invites the eye to travel along the surface as well. \nSince 1997, the Salt has been experimenting with the ways in which materials and textures absorb, reflect, and filter light. Because the firm has focused on window treatments, it is concerned with privacy, with managing light, and with the appearance of different materials in day and evening lighting. Many of Salt\u2019s textiles play with sheerness and opacity\u2014areas to look at and to look through, surfaces that attract the eye, and others that allow light and vision to pass through. Longitude, together with Horsehair and Kingfisher Floats, will update a collection of casement and architectural textiles with similar concerns from such important designers as Anni Albers, Marianne Strengell, and Jack Lenor Larsen.",
