    "description": "Black horse hairs used end to end as the weft, with several inches left unwoven at each side. The warp is white viscose used in irregular vertical bands. The horsehair is used more or less densely to create wide horizontal bands alternating between sheer and opaque.",
    "justification": "Horsehair, a material most commonly used for scratchy but durable 19th-century upholstery fabrics, is revitalized here in a simple structure that exploits the natural beauty of the material. The wide bands are formed by changes in density, which create translucent and opaque areas, and the unbound ends highlight the nature of the raw material.\nSince 1997, the Salt has been experimenting with the ways in which materials and textures absorb, reflect, and filter light. Because the firm has focused on window treatments, it is concerned with privacy, with managing light, and with the appearance of different materials in day and evening lighting. Many of Salt\u2019s textiles play with sheerness and opacity\u2014areas to look at and to look through, surfaces that attract the eye, and others that allow light and vision to pass through. Horsehair, together with Kingfisher Floats and Longitude, will update a collection of casement and architectural textiles with similar concerns from such important designers as Anni Albers, Marianne Strengell, and Jack Lenor Larsen.",
