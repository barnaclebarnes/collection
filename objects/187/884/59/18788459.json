    "justification": "Jewelry design is a significant part of the museum\u2019s decorative arts collection. Historically, the collection has focused on design elements that have sometimes included precious stones but more often are of stylistic interest. Jewelry acquisitions from the late 20th and early 21st century have tended to feature the work of studio designers but, as the museum\u2019s 2011 exhibition, Set in Style: The Jewelry of Van Cleef & Arpels illustrated, there are innovative designs in the world of high jewelry as well. \nThe butterfly has been a recurring motif for Van Cleef & Arpels, with designs ranging from realistic renderings to fanciful creatures in turquoise and rubies from the 1940s. The production of this brooch includes a combination of the art of working in gold and diamonds combined with Japanese lacquering techniques. The butterfly form is created in gold with a mother-of-pearl base in the Van Cleef & Arpels workshops in France. The pieces are then sent to Japan where the lacquering is created according to specific designs inspired by Japanese symbolism. Traditional design sources are rendered with a modern eye and enhanced with the use of materials, such as eggshell, worked into the lacquer for innovative finishes. \nThis brooch represents a combination of the craftsmanship associated with the decorative arts and high jewelry as well as the use of high jewelry\u2019s precious materials. Examples of Japanese lacquering techniques can be found elsewhere in the museum\u2019s collection, such as with inro, flattened cylindrical boxes with compartments that often held medicine.",
    "gallery_text": "The texture of this brooch results from different technical phases of craftsmanship. The gold and mother-of-pearl butterfly form created in Van Cleef &amp; Arpels\u2019 workshops traveled to Japan. There, master lacquerer Juinichi Hakose applied lacquer using centuries-old techniques to create both smooth and raised textures. Cut diamonds add further texture to the spine.",
