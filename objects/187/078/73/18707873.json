    "justification": "World War II had a profound impact on Britain\u2019s textile industry. Wartime austerity clothes-rationing severely curtailed textile production and Britain\u2019s utility scheme limited the scale of patterns and the color palette to rust, green, blue, and natural. Eager to regain their economic and aesthetic superiority in the industry after the war, British companies sought out collaborations with designers and artists to create new designs, many of which were influenced by the organic and abstract forms used by such artists as Joan Mir\u00f3, Paul Klee, and Alexander Calder. The Festival of Britain, held in London in 1951, was a showcase for these new design ideas known as the \u201cContemporary Style.\u201d \nHeal Fabrics, established in 1941, was a producer of both textiles and furniture and was one of the exhibitors at the festival. Under the direction of Tom Worthington from 1948 to 1971, Heal\u2019s developed an international reputation for well-designed contemporary fabrics, which were especially popular in the 1950s and 1960s. Heal\u2019s exhibit in the Homes and Gardens Pavilion  at the festival featured the work of the husband and wife design team, Robin and Lucienne Day, who were often compared to their United States contemporaries, Charles and Ray Eames. Lucienne\u2019s influential design, Calyx, was introduced at the festival and she remained a prominent figure in textile design for the next two decades, providing designs for several companies including British Celanese and Edinburgh Weavers. \nCauseway would be the second textile design by Lucienne Day in the collection. At the time of proposed acquisition, the museum has Calyx in two colorways, as well as reproduced in a wallpaper sample book.",
