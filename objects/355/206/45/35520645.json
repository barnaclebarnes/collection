    "gallery_text": "In 1832 Owen Jones embarked on a Grand Tour, travelling to Italy, Greece, Egypt, Turkey, and Spain. Along with fellow architect James Goury, Jones completed a detailed analysis of the Islamic decoration at the Alhambra Palace. Upon Goury\u2019s death in 1834, Jones returned to London and spent the next nine years publishing the results of their studies. In order to render the intricate decorations of the Alhambra in print, Jones pioneered new standards in chromolithography.\nOver the ensuing years Jones developed bold new theories on flat patterning, geometry, and abstraction in ornament. His carefully observed studies at the Alhambra were pivotal in this evolution. In 1856 Jones published The Grammar of Ornament as a design sourcebook, illustrating his principles in the arrangement of form and color in architecture and the decorative arts. Jones is best remembered for this publication due to its overwhelming influence and the fact that it is still in print today. In addition to his landmark work, Jones was also an accomplished architect and interior designer in London during the mid-1800s.",
