    "gallery_text": "For centuries, indigenous Alaskan communities practiced sustainable fishing. Many rituals preceded the hunt, including praying for spiritual assurance that animals would return next season in abundance. Indeed, this ingenious and highly specialized fishhook was made as beautiful as possible in order to please the halibut spirit and suited exactly the behavior and anatomy of these bottom-feeding fish, which live as deep as 274.3 m (900 ft.).The size of the hook\u2019s V-shaped gap determined the size of the catch, making it impossible to hook a halibut that a man couldn\u2019t haul into his boat. Baited with octopus, the hook was anchored by stone sinkers and rose about 60 cm (2 ft.) off the sea floor. Sections of bull kelp knotted together provided flexible and nearly unbreakable lines. Bird-shaped floats were attached to the tops of the lines, and when a fish was hooked, its weight pulled the bird float upright, signaling a catch.",
    "label_text": "Indigenous communities in Alaska were early practitioners of sustainable fishing. This fishhook suits exactly the anatomy of a halibut. The V-shaped gap insured that the intended catch was neither too large to haul into a boat nor too small. The skillful carving showed respect for the halibut, which would hopefully return in abundance and sustain the community.",
