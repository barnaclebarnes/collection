    "description": "At right a figure stands in full armor with his helmet up; his left hand is on his waist, and his right rests on the hilt of a sword. Another figure stands at left, leaning on a staff with a quiver of arrows hanging from his waist.  Both figures stand on a long arrow that spans the width of the board. The figures flank a shield, with charges of fleurs de Lille and  lions, and a banner bearing the motto: \"Dieu et Mon Droit.   Above is a lunette with a figure of a youth sitting on a ledge.  He wears a patterned robe with cape.  Framing the lunette, are two roses on either side with vine and leaves.",
