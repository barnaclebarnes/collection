    "description": "Pattern of a diamond grid with flowers at the interstices of the grid.\n\nPanel of thin, glazed, cream-colored cotton, painted in shades of red, blue, green, violet and drab; outlines and leaf veins and stems in gold. Pattern is a symmetrical plan in diamond shape, of delicate, intertwined grasses, joined, at points, with clusters of flowers and foliage; small flower sprays in diamond shaped field.\n\nA lattice plan is developed in bands, composed of fine groups of little sheaves of grain, painted in fine lines of dark blue and red, with blue tips, and in gold, crossing o form a diamond shaped ground.  At points of meeting of the gilded bands, there are flower clusters in various colors, and gold.  Three different patterns of flowers occur at these points; alternate clusters have dark green leaves curving down and crossing under the gilded bands. Within the diamond shapes are small detached leaf designs. The fresh and the gold adds much to the effect.\nThe pattern suggests the plan of eighteenth-century French embroideries.",
