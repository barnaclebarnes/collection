    "gallery_text": "The elm bark attush robe is one of the Ainu\u2019s most stunning art forms, and is vital to their tradition and ethnic identity. After the men carefully strip the elm of its bark, the women separate the outer and inner bark and split the fibers into long, narrow strips. These strands are twisted into thread and woven into strips on a backstrap loom or izaribata, which are sewn together to form the robe. Embroidery is applied to cotton cloth which is appliqu\u00e9d to the robe at strategic locations around the neck, wrists, and between the shoulder blades, in order to protect the wearer from evil spirits. This concept of spiritual protection is believed to derive from the rope that Ainu women used to encircle their sleeping children in order to safeguard them while the mother worked in the mountains or fields. Tattooing on the back of women\u2019s hands and around their arms employed similar curvilinear designs for protection from evil spirits.",
    "label_text": "Dynamic curvilinear designs on Ainu attush robes embellish strategic locations at the neck and wrists and between the shoulder blades to protect wearers from evil spirits. The patterns may derive from the rope with which Ainu women once encircled their sleeping children, to safeguard them while they worked in the mountains or fields.",
