    "description": "A large pedestal arrangement pertaining to implements for garden design. At top of column, three plumes representing the crown of His Royal Highness, The Prince of Wales decorated with garlands of flowers held by a nymph representing Flora. An old man, hunched over, warms his hands over a steaming pot. On the pedestal, greenery, flowers, twigs, a hatchet and pick. Flanking, a plaque inscribed: Gardens \/ are works of art \/ rather than of nature. To left, a large urn, chains and picks. At right a shovel, watering can, rake and telescope on a tripod. Below is a rock formation inscribed: Designs that are vast \/ only by their dimensions, are always \/ the sign of a common and low imagination; No work of art can be great but as it deceives \/ to be otherwise is the prerogative of nature only",
