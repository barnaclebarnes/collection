    "gallery_text": "Oliver Smith began his career as a scenic designer in New York in 1941, designing for Leonide Massine of Ballets Russes fame. Highlights of his prolific career include sets for productions for \"Brigadoon,\" \"West Side Story,\" \"My Fair Lady,\" and \"Hello, Dolly!\" as well as for major ballets. He also served as co-director of the American Ballet Theater from 1945 to 1980. For the 1958 Rodgers and Hammerstein production of \u201cFlower Drum Song,\u201d a comedic musical based on Chin Y. Lee\u2019s novel, Smith\u2019s sets evoke a lyrical and serene mood rather than provide a literal description of place. The play, which opened to commercial success at New York\u2019s St. James Theatre in 1958, deals with conflict between two generations of Chinese Americans over arranged marriages and romantic entanglements in 1950s San Francisco. This design, intended to be painted on a muslin curtain backdrop, was inspired by traditional Chinese painting. Smith contrasts scale and perspective to suggest foggy atmosphere and deep space, rather than using Western linear perspective. The two stark, expressive trees bracket the Golden Gate Bridge and evoke the minimalist, graceful forms characteristic of Chinese painting.",
