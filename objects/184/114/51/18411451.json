    "gallery_text": "The Teke were famous traders, situated at the river gateway between the Atlantic and the remainder of the Kuba kingdom. This superior trading position meant that they were the first to replace traditional raffia cloths with imported cottons, making skirts like this one particularly rare. Missionary John Weeks, who arrived in the area in 1882, recounted in Among the Primitive Bakongo the incredible fineness of the \u201cpalm frondlet\u201d textiles, while Frederick Starr, arriving in 1905, noted the prevalence of imported fabric. Plain raffia squares were used as currency or stitched together to form textiles. Although this rare Teke skirt is unadorned, the seams joining the individual panels reflect the waters that separate the earth from the sky in Teke cosmology, and the fringes are symbols of chiefhood.",
