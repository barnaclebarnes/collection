    "description": "The head of a female in the upper half of the page, left, is framed by ringlets on the left down to chin level and to eye level on the right. The heavily fringed eyes are almost closed, as are the full lips. The eyelids; left side of the face; and neck are shaded.\n\nAbove and to the right, a second female head is tilted to the left and down. Wavy hair frames the face above the eyebrow on the left and to ear-level on the right. The almond-shaped eyes are open and look down. Shading is used in the left eye area and, more heavily, on the right, in the lower part of the face and on the neck.",
