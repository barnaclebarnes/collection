    "description": "Four heads, three in frontal view and one in profile, are lightly sketched in the right half, and are labeled in ancient Roman-style capital letters. The heads are styled in the manner of ancient Roman sculpture or coin portraiture. On the top left, the head of a young man, turned toward the left, is dressed in wavy hair cascading down the right, and shows vestiges of a laurel wreath on top. He is identified as Caligula, imprinted next to the head on the top right. On the right, slightly below, the head of a mature man is abbreviated by the right edge of the page. The subject appears to be almost bald, with a few strands of hair sketched on the left. The label, to the left of the top of the head, reads Sculla. On the bottom right, the head, turning toward the right, shows a full head of wavy hair styled close to the scalp; he is also identified as Sculla, imprinted to the right of the head. The head on the lower left, in right profile, is delineated more sharply than the other three; the eyebrow, nose, hairline and cheek are depicted in curvaceous outline. The label, M[arc] Antonius, is imprinted to the right of the head at forehead l",
