    "gallery_text": "Ukrainian-born Simon Lissim found his greatest success in Paris, where he settled in 1921 and immediately began regularly exhibiting his paintings. In 1924, he designed his first piece for S\u00e8vres Porcelain Manufactory, and over the next thirty years, he created about 120 more pieces for the company. A versatile designer, Lissom worked not only in elegant tableware, but also in wallpaper, textiles, jewelry, metalwork, graphics, and set and costume design\u2014including projects for the Ballets Russes. Other commissions comprised designs for Martin & Duchet, Limoges, Royal Copenhagen, and Lenox. He maintained the passion for theater and opera instilled in him by his wealthy parents, and paradoxically, his high-end work shows influences of Russia\u2019s colorful folk art. As can be seen on this plate design, he emphasized a harmony of design and form. The abstract design twists inward, embracing the plate\u2019s curve but in an unexpected way and the depiction on the lower right, indicating the backside, suggests the plate would have an all-encompassing design. In 1941, Lissim emigrated to the United States, where he continued to practice design while beginning a career in art education in New York.",
