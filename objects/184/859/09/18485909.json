    "gallery_text": "American designer Donald Deskey studied painting at the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re and the Atelier L\u00e9ger in Paris, France from 1921 before returning to the US in 1923.  Many of his early works \u2014 perhaps best known are his interiors for Radio City Music Hall  \u2014 reflect this training and recall the abbreviated angularity of French Art Deco and the Cubists. A 1935 drawing for the design of the three-panel Lysistrata Lacquer Screen, featuring a fragmented female figure, is graphically simplified and imbued with Cubism\u2019s limited palette. (Over the course of his career, Deskey proved particularly adept, becoming one of the most prolific screen-makers of his time. ) Yet it signals the shifting sentiments towards design that began to take hold in America as the culture departed from its European counterparts.  From a growing desire and necessity for the mass market came the emergence of a uniquely American expression in the applied arts.  Designers, including Deskey, would come to embrace designing for mass production even as many continued to work with private wealthy clients, as Deskey did with this floor screen for author Gilbert Seldes.",
