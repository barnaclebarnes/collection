    "gallery_text": "Kashmir shawls were essential fashion accessories for stylish women of means in nineteenth-century Europe. Initially imported from India, they were superbly crafted and very expensive. Strong demand encouraged production of Kashmir-style shawls in several European countries. The French and British dominated European production using draw looms and jacquard looms. In contrast, Russian shawls were hand-woven, a function of the essentially feudal nature of the Russian economy in the early nineteenth century. The workforce consisted of enslaved serfs, many of who were very talented, highly skilled, and specially trained artisans.[i]\nIn about 1806, several small, estate-based textile workshops in Russia began the hand-woven production of Kashmir-style shawls. These workshops had previously produced carpets using reversible, plain weave, dovetail tapestry construction, a technique they applied with great success to shawls, producing two-sided fabrics of astonishing complexity.[ii] \nShawls from the Russian workshops won numerous prizes for their beautiful designs and fine craftsmanship at local and international exhibitions, including the Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851 in London.  After the abolition of serfdom in Russia in 1861, the cost of labor to hand-weave two sided shawl borders was prohibitive, and the production of these remarkable textiles in Russia largely came to an end.[iii]\n\n\n\n\n[i] Priscilla Roosevelt, Life on a Russian Country Estate: A Social and Cultural History (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995), 246-47.\n[ii] L.V.
