    "gallery_text": "This design consists of five different structures of the ancient world, all very stylized and patrolled by a peculiar cast of characters. Structures include the coliseum, the pantheon, ruins from the Roman Forum, and possibly a horreum or public warehouse. Appearing in front of each structure are Roman soldiers either on foot or horseback, or riding in a chariot. The figures are also highly stylized, appearing as caricatures. The design is printed in two colors on a soft yellow silk ground. \nEach of the colors is printed to suggest a linoleum block or rubber stamp print, or possibly much wear or abrasion, as one would expect to find on an \u201cancient\u201d artifact. The Museum collection contains several other wallpaper designs by Hawking for Denst & Soderlund that contain a similar look, giving his designs a handcrafted look, and a certain elegance. \nClarence Hawking is a graphic artist who joined the firm of Denst and Soderlund in 1951 as one of the chief designers. He remained with the company for a number a years and designed many wallpapers including both repeating patterns and murals. Denst and Soderlund was a Chicago-based company active from 1947-1961, at which time the duo parted ways and the firm became Jack Denst Designs. John R. Denst and Donald K. Soderlund both graduated from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1946 and founded their partnership the following year. After landing a major job with the Desert Inn in Las Vegas, the company began receiving orders from set designers and their wallpaper was used in the 1971 psychological thriller \u201cPlay Misty for Me.\u201d Denst was well known for his whimsical titles which intrigued the producers of \u201cWhat\u2019s My Line\u201d enough to ask him to appear as a guest in the early 1960s.",
