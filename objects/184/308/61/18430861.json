    "gallery_text": "The Qing imperial rulers (1644-1911) were of Manchu ethnicity, and ruled over a mostly Han population. For centuries, Manchu women were required to wear long one-piece robes and Han women two-piece outfits that included a jacket and skirt. Featuring elements of both traditions, this Manchu jacket demonstrates the increasing fusion of these fashions in the nineteenth century. Imperial decrees by the Qing emperors often criticized these trends, but to little avail. Contemporary ballads described how palace robes worn by Manchu women were \u201ccut in the style of the short jacket and skirt,\u201d the short jacket (magua\u99ac\u8902) being a key item in traditional Han dress. \n \nThe decorative focus of this jacket are the roundels of nine lions (jiu shi\u4e5d\u7345) cavorting against a background of begonia, lotus, and cymbidium blossoms and auspicious Buddhist symbols like the wheel of law, endless knot, lotus, conch, and vase. The lion motif  likely refers to \u201cnine generations under one roof\u201d \u2013 the punning ideal of a multi-generational Chinese household in which all family members live together in harmony (jiu shi tong tang\u4e5d\u7345\u540c\u5802). This garment also features multi-bordered sleeves and ruyi-shaped side borders, elements typical of Han dress.",
