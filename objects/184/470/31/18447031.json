    "gallery_text": "From the 1910s to 1930s, American artist and designer E. McKnight Kauffer received national renown in England, where he incorporated fine art styles into commercial art and helped to elevate posters to the status of paintings. At the outbreak of World War II, Kauffer moved to New York but struggled to achieve the same level of fame and success, though he did find work with corporate clients, war relief agencies, and other government organizations. The United Committee of South-Slavic Americans, which commissioned this poster, was formed in August 1943, and provided information on homeland news to the public. The poster praises Josip Broz, known as Tito, who at the time was leading a Communist resistance against Nazi Germany in Yugoslavia. Kauffer used black and red in an embrace of the Communist colors. He believed colors, along with form and symbol, were vital in commercial art to draw attention of passersby. Earlier in his career, he wrote that arrows in posters drew attention to neighboring images and away from the original advertisement. Here, the arrows travel in a conflicting but endless loop around a photograph of Tito in profile, ensuring that the viewer\u2019s eye remains within the frame.",
