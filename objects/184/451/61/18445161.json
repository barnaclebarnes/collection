    "gallery_text": "This embroidered nightcap represents a type of hat worn by English men beginning around 1550. Despite its name, it would not have been worn for sleeping, but during private moments throughout the day. Although most men wore their natural hair during this period (wigs only came into fashion in the 17th century), keeping the head covered and warm was thought to be part of a healthy lifestyle. \nThis hat\u2019s lavish decoration indicates the wealth and status of its wearer. It may have been embroidered by a woman in her home using designs from pattern books or from a draftsman, since embroidery was an important skill for women of status. It may also have been produced professionally, as embroidery was a flourishing trade in the 16th century. Most embroidered hats from this period feature floral designs with insects or birds, so this pattern, featuring rainbows, rainstorms, snails and caterpillars, is distinctive. The rainbows may represent the peace brought by Queen Elizabeth I after a time of political upheaval, and the caterpillars this transformation.",
