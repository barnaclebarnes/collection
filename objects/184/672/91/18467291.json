    "description": "Half of a palampore with a tree trunk in brilliant light red rises from a mound and curves heavily right before branching toward the top. Various flowers in brilliant red and dull violet with leaves in two shades of blue with red accents appear. Vestiges of yellow remain in leaves of small flower clusters. To left of the curved trunk appears a half medallion formed from ribbon knots and flowers framing a cluster of roses. The mound is comprised of pointed hillocks in reds, blues, and browns with much shading. A pheasant in many colors is perched on a short plant rising from the mound, and a small flowering tree is at the right end. Birds in branches are babblers. Finishing the right side and top, a border about twelve inches wide is composed of narrow festoons of ribbon and small flower clusters, and an outer festoon simulating a pale rose-colored ribbon with flower clusters at each curve in reds, blue, and pale violet. A narrow band of red is painted along the edge at the right side and across the top.",
