    "gallery_text": "American-born graphic artist E. McKnight Kauffer began his commercial arts career as a teenager working as a scene painter for a theater stock company, then as an assistant to a bookseller and art dealer in San Francisco. There, a university professor saw his artistic potential and sent him to Europe to study painting in the 1910s. He eventually settled in London, where he lived until the outbreak of World War II. Incorporating fine-art sensibilities into commercial design\u2014such as for the London Underground\u2014he became one of the country\u2019s most acclaimed poster designers, helping to raise the status of the commercial arts to that of the fine arts. He combined simple, symbolic forms and bold colors with sparse, bold, and straightforward text. Here, silhouettes of women float against a spiral background, possibly inspired by expressionist painting, to encourage traveling by the LUD to shop at winter sales. Despite Kauffer's renown, he was not without critics, including typographers. He refused to adjust letter spacing, sometimes resulting in an uneven composition. As he did in this poster on the lower text lines, he sometimes added a triangle motif at the end of lines to accommodate for the awkward spacing.",
