    "gallery_text": "ISSUE OF WHAT IS DEPICTED NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED BY CURATORS. DESCRIPTION CALLS IMAGE \"SKYSCRAPER,\" BUT BASED ON THE MUSEUM ADVERTISED, THE OBJECT'S FORM, AND THE WORD \"STIBNITES\" UNDER THE DRAWING, I BELIEVE THE DRAWING DEPICTS STIBNITES, A JAGGED MINERAL. When Kauffer arrived in England in the mid-1910s as a painter, he became involved in avant-garde artists' groups. Finding success in posters\u2014and seeing no status differentiation between fine and commercial arts\u2014he decided to give up painting for advertising design. He received his first poster commission in 1915 from Frank Pick, London Underground Electric Railways\u2019 publicity manager, who helped to bring a progressive, modernist image to the Underground. Kauffer eventually designed around 150 posters and car-cards for the Underground. Each poster design typically had a 1,000-issue print run, 150 of which were reserved for selling to individuals, schools, and businesses, who used the modern designs as wall decoration. Kauffer\u2019s posters were widely praised, and he helped to forge a renaissance of British poster design during the interwar period, employing in his designs fine-arts styles from Cubism to expressionism. He promoted simple, geometric designs that attracted attention, as shown in this abstract depiction of the jagged, metallic mineral stibnites that could likely be found at the advertised London Museum of Practical Geology. As was typical of Kauffer, he used a symbolic form rather than a realistic depiction or shocking image to promote a place or product.",
