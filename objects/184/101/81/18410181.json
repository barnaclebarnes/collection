    "description": "In the top left-hand corner, a female in left profile wears a close-fitting cap, from which curly hair escapes next to the face and down the back of the neck. A button earring appears where the ear would be. Shading is used under the eyebrow and in the cheekbone area. The rounded chin continues upward in a curve ending at the earring. Several letters are scattered on either side of the head. \n\nA second head in left profile, tilted upward, occupies the center of the page. Under a curved brown slanting upward and intersecting the hairline, the empty, wide open eye socket is heavily shaded. Shading is also used in the cheekbone area and is heaviest under the line extending upward from the chin to the ear vicinity. Curly hair frames the face, stopping at ear level.\n\nDirectly below the second head, a frontal head, possibly male, abuts the bottom edge of the page. The eyes, wide open, glance upward under gently curved brows. Shading is heaviest on the left side. The lips are closed and full. A wavy line suggesting the hair is drawn at eye level from one side to the other across the top of the head.",
