    "description": "This view of a fleshy-faced man occupies the whole sheet, which was torn from a pad of paper. Many sketched lines, integrated particularly in the depiction of the eyes and nose, along with a protruding lower lip, convey an expression of displeasure or consternation. The right hand holds a telephone receiver close to the hidden ear. Norfolk Southern Railway is imprinted at the top of the page; the company logo appears just below on the left; and the name and telephone number of James R. Allen, an official, are imprinted on the right.\n\nPerhaps Gustav Jensen sketched the present view while traveling by rail.",
