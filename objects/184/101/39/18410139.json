    "description": "In this full page view of a woman, her face turns toward the left and her hooded, almond-shaped eyes, under straight brows, glance in the same direction. Her short hair, formed by thick lines, is swept back on the crown, perhaps under a headdress; a few loose strands escape in the center of the forehead and behind the left ear. From under the left ear, adorned by an earring, the diagonal jaw line extends, squaring off in the chin. The outline of the opposite side of her face reveals a high cheekbone.",
