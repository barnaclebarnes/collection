    "description": "Long valance-shaped fragment of coarse cotton. Design is incomplete, but shows a large floral motif and foliage. Background is blue and the design is reserved in white with blue accents and interior lines. Parts of the foliage are outlined in small white dots, and larger leaves contain interior decoration of white dots. The fragment might be the lining of a valance and is pieced with lighter shades of the same design to make a scalloped shape.",
