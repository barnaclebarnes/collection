    "description": "Scenic rectangular panel with a frontal perspective of a plaza or garden. The vanishing point is at the center of the panel. Design shows an arched gate with hanging floral garlands at one end of the plaza (top, rear) flanked on both sides by an open arcade supported by spiral columns encircled by spiraling floral vines. On the bannister between each column is an urn of flowers. Urns decorate the top of the arcade and birds fill the sky above. In the center of the tiled arcade (center foreground) is an elaborate spouting fountain with spouting mermen and seahorses. Facing the fountain, left and right, are animals and birds: a rooster, dog, peacock, rabbit, stag, tortoise, monkey, crane. Rendered in multicolored silk and metal-wrapped yarns tarnished to black. Metal fountain and columns in raised metal couching. The perspective is very forceful and overpowers the pictorial unity.",
