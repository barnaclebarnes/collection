    "gallery_text": "In rural homes, overshot coverlets were the primary form of bedroom decoration. The term \"overshot\" refers to the long spans of wool supplementary weft that are used to pattern the plain cotton foundation. While some overshot coverlets were undoubtedly produced by professionals, home production by men and women on simple four-harness looms was very common. Families in rural Appalachia continued to make their own coverlets until the early twentieth century. This coverlet fragment was made in western Georgia around 1850 in an area south of the Appalachian Mountains. The weaver took a deceptively simple checkerboard pattern and created an eye-catching optical effect by gradually compressing the squares at regular intervals both vertically and horizontally to create a dazzling, almost dizzying, repeat pattern of rounded squares. The blue color was most certainly made using indigo dye, while the tan color could have been produced by native trees, shrubs or herbs.",

Beginning with an ordinary checkerboard pattern, the weaver produced an eye-catching optical effect by gradually compressing the squares at regular intervals, both vertically and horizontally.
