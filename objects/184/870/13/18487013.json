    "gallery_text": "Among Donald Deskey\u2019s most impressive and memorable contributions to American design were his elegant interiors for Radio City Music Hall, one of the first projects that sealed his future fate as a leader in an emerging industrial design profession. Though Deskey \u2014 relatively unknown to average person at that time \u2014 was not well paid for the project,  his contract was extensive in scope: He ultimately designed the music venue\u2019s lobby furniture, wall coverings, lighting fixtures, railings, mirrors, and carpeting, such as the repeat pattern of stylized women\u2019s profiles he created for the 5,901-seat  auditorium. Called Singing Women, the wavy-haired, open-mouthed faces alternate in color between tan and purple forming a chevron-like arrangement.  In 1978, the building was marked for demolition before gaining landmark status and a decade-long restoration began in 1990s. Thanks in large part to the Deskey Archives at Cooper-Hewitt and particularly this drawing dated 1932 \u2014 the same year Radio City opened to the public \u2014 an architectural team was able to accurately replicate Deskey\u2019s original design using wool and nylon fiber  to revive it to its original grandeur.",
    "label_text": "Deskey supervised the interior decoration of Radio City Music Hall. His design with bands of cubist-inspired female heads in profile was selected for the Hall\u2019s auditorium carpet. The flat, nearly abstract motif suited a carpet that would be subject to heavy wear.",
