    "description": "Pieced bedcover made of several sections. The center section is cream linen embroidered in cream silk with detached small-scale flower designs embroidered in colored silks. The center section also has shield-shaped corner designs and a central oval medallion with an embroidered border framing a white swan. Wide borders have been formed from another hanging or bedcover and are embroidered in a large-scale tree and flower design with exotic birds. A narrow border has been cut from a twill weave cotton embroidered in chain stitch in a small-scale floral pattern, probably Indian.",
