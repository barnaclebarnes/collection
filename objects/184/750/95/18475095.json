    "description": "Large hanging with white and brown figures on a brown ground composed of thirteen pieces joined together. Identifical top and bottom borders contain a single horizontal row repeat of triple candle, star and a bowl of flowers pattern. The two remaining borders have vertical row repeat of double candle, stars, and a bowl of flowers. At the bottom, extending along entire width of the bottom is a scene of lambs, cows, boys, trees, flowers and a chandelier enclosed beneath archways patterned with rectangles and zigzag motif. Above the bottom row on each end are two scenes of male and female figures kneeling with two birds and stars overhead \u2013 the male is holding, left, a necklace with a cross, while the female figure holds a bird with crown. On the right, the male holds a dog; the female, a chalice with a cross. The two center pieces depict more lamps in archways and birds, and Mary holding the haloed baby Jesus surrounded by candles, archways and attended by another woman. The single piece above these four pieces is a scene of a medieval village with many flags and castle towers. There are five repeats of this scene in a vertical row above the town. Above the town, in the next row, fly four angels, one carries a banner \"Gloria Deo\" and another, a banner with \"in exce\/lsis.\"",
