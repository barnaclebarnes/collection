    "gallery_text": "A state bed with the cypher of the French Regent Philippe Charles, Duc d'Orleans is seen in front elevation in this architectural scheme for the Palais Royal in Paris. In the early years of the regency (1715-23), following the death of Louis XIV, the center of French politics shifted from Versailles to Paris. The regent sought to assert his authority by remodeling his Parisian residence.  The architect Gilles-Marie Oppenord was given the task of redesigning large portions of the palace, including the regent\u2019s private and state apartments. This meticulous ink drawing shows a scheme for the bed alcove in the regent\u2019s bedroom. Set behind a balustrade and flanked by composite columns, the design recalls the late king\u2019s state bedroom at Versailles. By appropriating this symbol of absolute power and evoking the grand Italianate style of Louis XIV, the duke sought to stress dynastic continuity. The room was demolished in 1748 to make way for the building of the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise theatre.",
    "label_text": "In 1905, the Hewitt sisters were introduced to Jean-L\u00e9on Decloux in Paris during one of their acquisitions trips. Decloux collected drawings, print albums, and decorative arts objects, and soon became one of their agents for purchasing works on paper. To cement the relationship, he quickly donated examples of French ornamental paneling. On Decloux\u2019s recommendation, the Hewitt sisters encouraged the museum\u2019s advisory council to purchase over 500 drawings from Decloux\u2019s collection in 1911; in 1921, the museum acquired 413 albums of Decloux\u2019s ornament prints and related preparatory drawings.",
