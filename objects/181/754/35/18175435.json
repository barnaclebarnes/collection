Through a combination of broad strokes, soakings, and calligraphic gestures, he was able to convey this wilderness scene and to express the serenity of man in harmony with his majestic surroundings.\nBeginning in 1912, Winslow Homer\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Savage Homer Jr., donated to the museum over 250 drawings from Homer\u2019s studio in Prouts Neck, Maine, and 22 oil paintings hanging in their home. Charles was acquainted with the Hewitt sisters and also knew the painter Elliot Clark, who was acquiring American drawings on the Hewitt sisters\u2019 behalf. With the acquisition of additional material, the museum now holds the largest group of works by Homer in any private or public collection.",
