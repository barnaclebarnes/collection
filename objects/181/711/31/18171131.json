    "gallery_text": "A grand triumphal arch looms against a cloudy sky, its stately silhouette surmounted by a victor\u2019s chariot. Below, diminutive figures gesture in admiration at the Neoclassical edifice.  This careful pen and ink design by the Swedish artist Louise-Gustave Taraval was likely made to commemorate the victories of King Adolphus Frederick of Sweden against Prussia. The tradition of erecting triumphal arches to celebrate military success originated in the Roman Republic. The practice regained popularity in the eighteenth century, as great numbers of artists and designers traveled to Italy where they absorbed architectural lessons from the ancient world. The triple arch of Taraval\u2019s design has precedents in Rome\u2019s Arch of Septimius Severus (AD 203), and the Arch of Constantine (AD 312). Court pageantry could use archways as focal point for parades, fireworks and other festivities. Although Taraval was a court architect for Louis XV of France, he made several designs for Swedish court activities. The design of the arch features the triple crown of the Swedish coat of arms and on the keystone is the symbol for the Order of the Polar Star, a chivalric order created by the King of Sweden in 1748.",
    "label_text": "In 1905, the Hewitt sisters were introduced to Jean-L\u00e9on Decloux in Paris during one of their acquisitions trips. Decloux collected drawings, print albums, and decorative arts objects, and soon became one of their agents for purchasing works on paper. To cement the relationship, he quickly donated examples of French ornamental paneling. On Decloux\u2019s recommendation, the Hewitt sisters encouraged the museum\u2019s advisory council to purchase over 500 drawings from Decloux\u2019s collection in 1911; in 1921, the museum acquired 413 albums of Decloux\u2019s ornament prints and related preparatory drawings.",
