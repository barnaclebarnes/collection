    "description": "Vertical rectangle. Above: Two angular balusters stand upon a base. They are connected by a joint in the shape of the shaft of a symmetrical baluster and by festoons pending from the central molding of the joint and from rosettes in the front panels of the balusters. Two crossed cornucopiae are supported by the joint and the cresting of the balusters. In the interval is a bust of a warrior framed by a slope of a garland, possibly belonging to the festoons. Below: Two circular pedestals support vases, with bases. The lower part of the shaft is decorated with a calice, the upper with panels. The body of the cases consists of trapezia with representations, the feet, the necks, the covers are circular. The pedestals are connected by a twisted bar, with an estucheon with a mask in the center. The latter is connected by festoons with rosettes in the front panels. The background of both projects is colored.",
