    "gallery_text": "Bandboxes were quite popular during the first half of the 19th century and were used for the storage and transport of men's collar bands, hats, and as general carry-alls. While some bandbox exteriors were covered with wallpaper, most were wrapped with papers made specifically for coverings bandboxes. These papers frequently contained landscape, hunt or mythological scenes. During the 1830s-40s many paeprs were printed with scenes commemorating historic events. They could be rather crudely printed in just a few colors and often show a naivet\u00e9 found in art.\nMany of the scenes printed on bandboxes are copied from existing prints. This design of General Zachary Taylor, Old Rough and Ready, appears to be a compilation of a couple different prints. The image of Taylor sitting sidesaddle on his horse, sword at his side, one arm raised is a nearly identical copy of a sketch drawn during the Battle of Palo Alto. This was the first major battle of the Mexican\u2013American War fought on May 8, 1846. The printed version is shown in reverse indicating a copy of the sketch was traced onto the woodblock. The image of the tents seems to have been inspired by a drawing of Taylor\u2019s troops when encamped at Corpus Christ a year earlier. His victories in the Mexican-American war helped get him elected as the 12th President of the United States, serving from March 1849 until his death in July 1850. Taylor earned the nickname \u201cOld Rough and Ready\u201d through his success in the Seminole War,  a conflict between various groups of Native Americans and the United States, fought from 1835 to 1842 in Florida.",
