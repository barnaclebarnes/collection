    "gallery_text": "Harrison was thrust into the limelight for his Indian campaigns while a territorial Governor in the mid-west. After the war he served in the U.S. House of Representatives (1816-19), the Ohio State Senate (1819-21) and the U.S. Senate (1825-28). Harrison was the candidate for the Whig Party in 1840 and for his election campaign Harrison was packaged as a war hero and a frontiersman. This made Harrison the butt of political jokes by his opponents the Democrats, one of which is illustrated on the bandbox. His opponents said that he was such a yokel that \"upon condition of his receiving a pension of $2,000 and a barrel of cider, General Harrison would no doubt consent to withdraw his presidential pretensions and spend his days in a log cabin on the banks of the Ohio\". He is illustrated on the bandbox greeting an old veteran in front of a cabin. There is a barrel of cider by his side and the Ohio River runs through the background. Despite the puns against him Harrison was elected the 9th president of the United States in 1840. At the age of 67, he was the oldest man elected president. After serving only a month he was also the first to die in office.",
