A dragon, lion and Cerberus, a three-headed hound from classical mythology, all bare their teeth and menacingly. These lively sketches have the loose, expressive quality of an artist laying down a preliminary idea. They were likely made as part of a bas relief design for a bronze garden fountain. Charles Le Brun, who is known primarily for Versailles interior decoration, made an enormous contribution to the decoration of the palace\u2019s gardens. Le Brun enlivened the formal gardens laid out by landscape designer Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre  with a profusion of statuary and fountains. The famous labyrinth of Versailles was a hedge maze with groups of sculptural fountains depicting animals from Aesop's fables. Here, the lion\u2019s appearance  is fiercely exagerated. Le Brun developed a theory of expression which examined animal physiology. He identifies the lion\u2019s large brow as a sign of courage and strength.",
