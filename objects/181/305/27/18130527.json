    "description": "Fragment of woven silk with eight-pointed stars containing regardant leopards or cheetahs alternating with palmettes and leaf forms. The stars are formed from parallelograms with lattice-like fillings. The leopard or cheetah pairs are surrounded by inlaced bands and pointed foliage. In cream and gold on a dark blue ground.",

    "gallery_text": "This Spanish textile features confronted leopards or cheetahs within a geometric framework, an enduring motif that probably originated in early Islamic Egypt or Persia. Woven in the 15th century by Islamic weavers, this silk lampas may have been produced in Almer\u00eda, a center of silk production in Andaluc\u00eda and a source of blue and gold textiles with similar motifs. Although it is unclear whether the spotted cats are leopards or cheetahs, elongated spots below their eyes suggest the \u201ctear lines\u201d below a cheetah\u2019s eyes. The collars on the animals may refer to the tradition of Persian kings using leashed cheetahs as hunting animals, a practice that Frederick II (1194-1250), the Holy Roman Emperor, brought to Europe. The pose of the cats recalls heraldry, the art of creating emblems for aristocratic houses, sometimes found on period garments.",
