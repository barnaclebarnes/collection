    "gallery_text": "This drawing after the French architect Germain Boffrand  (1667- 1754) shows an elevation of the bedroom of Charles de Rohan, Prince of Soubise in his private Parisian residence, H\u00f4tel de Soubise, still standing at 60 rue des Francs-Bourgeois in the 3rd Arrondissement. The drawing is a preparatory drawing for engraving as it is incised for transfer and published as Plate LXVI (?) in Boffrand\u2019s architectural treatise, Livre d'architecture contenant les principes generaux de cet art (1745). The drawing shows the bed alcove and a wall with a fireplace. To the left of the fireplace is a new type of paneling invented by Boffrand as previous architectural rules would have had a fake door to match the double paneled door to the right of the fireplace. The stops in the panels are adorned with sculpted cartouches representing the virtues while the overdoor painting represents \u201cAurora and Cephalus,\u201d (1738-39) by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher to the right, and the \u201cThe Marriage of Hercules and Hebe\u201d (1737) by Pierre Charles Tr\u00e9moli\u00e8re to the left. The design presents a total integrated Rococo interior that unites paintings with interior paneling and ornamental motifs. Boffrand\u2019s architectural designs were particularly instrumental in disseminating French style across continental Europe.",
