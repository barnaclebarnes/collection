    "gallery_text": "Broad swathes of brown wash block out the figures in this preliminary study for a ceiling in the Palazzo Barberini, Rome. Loose lines of ink deliniate the gestures and contours of Divine Wisdom and her eleven maidens, each personifying various qualities of wisdom. The design\u2019s dense allegorical subtext was intended to glorify the Barberini family. The free exploration evident in this drawing suggest it was among the first of many preparatory drawings for the fresco. Several compositional changes would occur between this and the final work. However, it is the only known drawing connected with the project. The circle behind Divine Wisdom\u2019s head represents the blinding light of the sun. The sweeping curve at the lower half of the page indicates the earth. In the final fresco, an enormous globe would dominate the composition. The inclusion of these two heavenly bodies can be understood as a response to Galileo\u2019s recently published \u2013 and challenged- theories of heliocentricity. The design dispenses with all architectural framing devices normally found in illusionistic ceiling frescos. Situated in the large antechamber to the family\u2019s private chapel, viewers are intended to contemplate the scene before entering the chapel, where they could pray for divine wisdom and guidance.",
