    "gallery_text": "This enigmatic design by Giulio Romano of a boat shaped vessel flanked by siren-topped columns has been interpreted variously as being a salt cellar, a festival float and a cradle. The difficulty in identifying the design\u2019s purpose stems from Romano\u2019s prolific production at Federico II Gonzaga\u2019s ducal court at Mantua. His work ranged from architecture and stage sets to metalwork and tapestries. This ink and chalk design is clear enough to be interpreted by various media, including metalwork and carved wood. The vessel is in the shape of a ship supported by two mermaids who float upon a base representing the sea. Aquatic themes were frequently incorporated into salt cellars, referencing the valuable mineral\u2019s watery origins. The double-tailed mermaid is associated with the Emperor Charles V, suggesting the design could have been made as part of the decorations for a banquet given by the Gonzagas in honor of the emperor in 1530. The identification of object as a dynastic cradle to celebrate the birth of an heir would suggest it was made for the enfant Francesco III Gonzaga, born in 1533. The tradition of publicly presenting an heir within an ornate cradle and under a textile canopy was practiced by prominent families throughout Italy.",
    "label_text": "In 1905, the Hewitt sisters were introduced to Jean-L\u00e9on Decloux in Paris during one of their acquisitions trips. Decloux collected drawings, print albums, and decorative arts objects, and soon became one of their agents for purchasing works on paper. To cement the relationship, he quickly donated examples of French ornamental paneling. On Decloux\u2019s recommendation, the Hewitt sisters encouraged the museum\u2019s advisory council to purchase over 500 drawings from Decloux\u2019s collection in 1911; in 1921, the museum acquired 413 albums of Decloux\u2019s ornament prints and related preparatory drawings.",
