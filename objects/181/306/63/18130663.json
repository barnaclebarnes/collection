    "gallery_text": "This Hispano-Moresque fragment, likely from Granada, was woven during the Nasrid dynasty (1232-1492) \u2013 the last Muslim kingdom in Spain. In the fourteenth century, colorful and delicate geometric designs were generously woven with gold thread to produce textiles with a jewel-like quality. In this example, the interlaced forms of the previous century have evolved into a complex pattern of slim gold rings linked by lobed medallions. Inside each ring is a symmetrical arrangement of lotus leaves enclosed by a palmette wreath. Pointed rosettes adorn the spaces between the rings. \nThe Nasrid dynasty attracted many talented weavers who were displaced during the Christian re-conquest in other parts of Spain. From their kingdom in the southern Iberian Peninsula, the Nasrids paid tribute to Castile by presenting gifts of fine textiles to the nobility and high-ranking members of the Catholic Church. These textiles were highly prized throughout Spain as the high quality of the weaving along with the use of silk and gold thread immediately identified the recipient as someone important.",
