The zigzag registers contain Islamic prayers glorifying the Prophet Muhammad and his traditional Companions: Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali. The design of this cover, the content of its inscriptions, and its green color indicate that it is a \u201cMedina the Radiant\u201d shroud, part of the Ottoman Sultan\u2019s annual gift of fine coverings for the markers of the tomb of the Prophet (Ravza-i Mutahhara) and of the graves of the Companions in Medina. Red and black inscribed textiles were also sent each year to dress the Ka\u2019ba in Mecca. After decorating one of the holiest sites in Islam, this cover was most likely returned to the Topkap\u03b9 Palace (the Sultan\u2019s seat of power in Istanbul), where pieces of it could have been recut as clothing, Qur\u2019an covers, and tomb covers by the Ottoman elite.",
