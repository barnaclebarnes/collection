    "description": "Design for a bedroom.  Only the main wall is depicted.  Three steps lead up to an alcove, the center of which is occupied by a bed.  The bed is framed by a drapery, pulled back by two female statues.  Unevenly spaced columns support the front entablature.  Four candelabra stand between the columns.  The candelabra are composed of a warrior and a girl supporting trays with candlesticks.  The wall behind is richly ornamented with reliefs.  Two main relief panels show two figures leaning against large oval medallions.  At the top, is a part of a curved ceiling, showing two captives and trophies of weapons, two girls beside an escutcheon, a segment of a painting, the sky, and putti.  At the far left is shown a small fragment of the elevation of the alcove niche and a part of a wing of a folding door.  At the bottom of the composition is an indication of the scale: 12 Pieds.",

    "gallery_text": "Rich stucco decorations overtake this opulent neoclassic bedroom designed by Gilles-Paul Cauvet (1731-88), the director of Acad\u00e9mie de Saint Luc, the guild for artisans and decorative painters. Cauvet was a prominent sculptor and designer at the French court, not only working for Louis XVI\u2019s brother and Marie Antoinette, but also on several Parisian h\u00f4tels (private residences) including the H\u00f4tel Mailly-Nesle, depicted here. This h\u00f4tel was first built in the seventeenth-century on the quai Voltaire in Paris. A luxuriously draped lit \u00e0 l\u2019Italienne is presented behind a colonnade of columns and candelabras composed of sculptures of maids and soldiers. The back wall is ornamented with neoclassical motifs as well as decorations inspired by the Jean Berain and Pierre Le Pautre. The motif of female figures flanking a large medallion is particularly evocative of Primaticcio\u2019s decorations for Fontainebleau in the sixteenth-century. On the cornices of the curved ceiling are military trophies and the emblems at the foot of the bed suggests that this room was likely executed for the Marquis de Mailly. This drawing is a prime reflection of an era where sculpture prevailed over painting in interior decorations.",
