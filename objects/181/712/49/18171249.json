    "gallery_text": "A flying putto pulls a sheet over a design for a corner motif of a painted ceiling by the French academician and painter Fran\u00e7ois Boucher. The date of 1740 locates this drawing alongside the artist\u2019s other architectural drawings, which are rare and usually in pen and brown ink. This drawing, executed on tracing paper with graphite underdrawing, shows two nymphs seated on either side of an incense burner. In front, a naked youth and a robed woman are seated on the concave entablature. Several putti peek their head into the scene. The lack of iconographical emblems makes it difficult to figure out the allegory represented. The dynamic diagonals of their poses are reminiscent of Baroque decorations but when compared to Boucher\u2019s architectural designs inspired by Annibale Caracci or Gilles-Marie Oppenord, this design is closer to the grand manner classicism exemplified in the interiors of Versailles. In fact, Boucher produced paintings for Versailles from 1735-6 and made drawings of figures in di sotto in s\u00f9 (a type of extreme foreshortening) after ceiling paintings in Versailles by his old teacher Fran\u00e7ois Lemoyne. The drawing, then, is likely a capriccio (an imaginary scene) that combines his studies after French and Italian interiors with Boucher\u2019s own architectural imagination.",
