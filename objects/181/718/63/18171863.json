    "gallery_text": "Dancers in outrageous costumes and masks mingle in a lavish interior. This drawing likely depicts a Parisian vauxhall, which were public entertainment spaces that became fashionable in France in the late 1760s, that played host to art exhibitions, concerts, balls, and other public spectacles until the late 1770s. Iconic characters of the commedia dell\u2019arte such as the hunchback Punchinello and the Pierrot dance amongst the crowd while on one side, a group of people are dressed as yew trees, likely referencing the Yew Tree Ball held at Versailles on 25 February 1745, where Louis XV came disguised as a yew tree. Delafosse may have modeled the costumes after designs by Louis-Ren\u00e9 Boquet or other costume designers working for the Menus plaisirs du roi or for the Acad\u00e9mie royale de musique. The grandiose interior is in fact a capriccio, an imaginary or fantastical space overflowing with Jean-Charles Delafosse\u2019s exuberant decorations in the Greek style, an early form of neoclassicism that emerged in the 1760s. Such highly finished drawings were likely owned by a collector interested in the licentious spectacles at Parisian vauxhalls.",
    "label_text": "In 1905, the Hewitt sisters were introduced to Jean-L\u00e9on Decloux in Paris during one of their acquisitions trips. Decloux collected drawings, print albums, and decorative arts objects, and soon became one of their agents for purchasing works on paper. To cement the relationship, he quickly donated examples of French ornamental paneling. On Decloux\u2019s recommendation, the Hewitt sisters encouraged the museum\u2019s advisory council to purchase over 500 drawings from Decloux\u2019s collection in 1911; in 1921, the museum acquired 413 albums of Decloux\u2019s ornament prints and related preparatory drawings.",
