    "description": "Elevation of a fountain. In the middle of the basin, is a figure of a reclining water god. Along the central axis, to either side of the figure, are two Doric columns. The left one has an angular pedestal with dolphins at the corners, water pouring from their mouths. The two columns are fluted and covered in two rows of friezes: the lower row is broad, with a carved figural narrative, while the upper row is smaller, and with an inscription \"NON PLVS\". The right column stands with two pedestals, the lower of which is round, the upper square with eagles, supporting festoons at the corners. The fluted column in its lower part surrounded by an angularly broken frieze with figures. The columns are topped by point finials and surrounded by one more band corresponding to the lower ones.",
