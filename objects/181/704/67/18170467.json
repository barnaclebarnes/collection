    "gallery_text": "The chariot of Apollo charges across the sky amidst a dazzling burst of sunlight. Allegorical figures in faux architectural niches frame the scene in this grand trompe l\u2019oeil ceiling design. Juste Aur\u00e8le Meissonier, the Italian-born giant of the eighteenth century, produced this colorful presentation drawing as part of a commission for the cabinet of Count Bielinski, the grand marshal of Poland. Meissonier succeeded Jean Berain as designer to the French king in 1726. Consequently, he had clients among the highest international court circles, including those in Poland and Portugal. Meissonier\u2019s monumental ceiling composition employs a heavy-handed illusionism influenced by Piero da Cortona and the Roman Baroque tradition. Designs for the Bielinski cabinet included furniture, an ornate fireplace and painted wall panels. Completed in 1735, the work would have been executed by several teams of craftsmen specializing in various materials including wood, stone, plaster, paint and upholstery. After construction, the room was exhibited at the Tuileries in Paris before its dispatch to Warsaw, as described in the journal Mercure de France in July 1736. Today, the location of the cabinet is unknown and it believed to have been destroyed.",
    "label_text": "In 1905, the Hewitt sisters were introduced to Jean-L\u00e9on Decloux in Paris during one of their acquisitions trips. Decloux collected drawings, print albums, and decorative arts objects, and soon became one of their agents for purchasing works on paper. To cement the relationship, he quickly donated examples of French ornamental paneling. On Decloux\u2019s recommendation, the Hewitt sisters encouraged the museum\u2019s advisory council to purchase over 500 drawings from Decloux\u2019s collection in 1911; in 1921, the museum acquired 413 albums of Decloux\u2019s ornament prints and related preparatory drawings.",
