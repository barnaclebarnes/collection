The Mar\u00e9chal gestures towards his wife, who stoops to greet him at the doorway (surmounted by family crest and pair of lions) of  the family mausoleum; his son (also in classical military garb) kneels and kisses his father's left hand.  The angel of death, holding a scythe, hovers above.  Smoke emanates from censors on either side of the central group.",

    "gallery_text": "This highly finished drawing is a speculative design for a tomb by the French academician and sculptor Augustin Pajou (1730-1809). It is an audacious composition that presents a novel outlook on death and the afterlife in eighteenth-century France. It was designed for Charles-Louis-Auguste Fouquet ( 1684 - 1761), Mar\u00e9chal de Belle-Isle who enjoyed an illustrious military and political career under Louis XV. In Pajou\u2019s design, Mar\u00e9chal is received by his pre-deceased wife and his son, all dressed all\u2019antica and their poses inspired by baroque catafalques. The figures replace the Christian allegorical figures that would normally be in their places according to conventions of tomb design. In the background, the angel of death closes the door to the sepulchral chamber to indicate that the Mar\u00e9chal is the last of his line to die.  Pajou has created an imaginary architectural space not privy to the living\u2014a glimpse inside the sepulchral chamber for the dead spirits. This design negotiates traditional visual imagery with innovative narratives--that of the tragic extinction of a family line \u2013and echoes a transitional moment when Enlightenment ideals influenced representations of death and the afterlife.",
