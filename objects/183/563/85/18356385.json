    "description": "Vertical rectangle. Beside the mensa are panels of the dado. The panel between the support bears a monogram framed by two crossed branches. The altar furniture is decorated at the front with festoons. Above it stand beside a crucifix, at left a candle and a figure; at right two candles and a figure. The figures stand in front of pilaster strips framing the central panel with a frame for a picture, and a glory as background. Above the panels of the dado is a high panel with a, probably carved, candelabrum with a burning fire, and a lower one. The vaulted ceiling has three panels, the central one with two sitting angels beside a circular frame. Colored framing background.",
