    "description": "Vertical rectangle. First row: two left sides; at left: similar to -1368, with the lateral part receding and decorated with a panel; at right: similar to -1368, with one front panel, the cross being framed by crossed branches. Second row: similar to -1368, the cross being without a frame, in the free space between the two panels. Third row: a left corner part. The part outside is curved and the support of the cornices is a gaine with a cherub. The beginning of the main part is similar to the project in the second row, with an enriched decoration of the projecting part. Fourth row: at left: the left half, similar to the first row, right; the cross being framed by a circle, a console with a festoon taking the place of the triglyph, and a similar motif seen in profile, added laterally. At right: a variation of the first row, at right, the cross being framed by a wreath of branches, and with a pillar tapered towards the base and having a kind of a capital in the place of the lateral panel. Lowest row: at left: a part of the left half; a variation of the project in the second row, with a rectangle at the front. At right: the left half. Mouldings frame, above and below, the front. The corner is bevelled and in front of the oblique side stands a console. Usual background.",
