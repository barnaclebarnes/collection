An oak wreath, on dark blue field, surrounds a circular medallion with gray frame containing seated female figure; she leans upon a staff surmounted by a Liberty Cap, and holds in her right hand a small figure of Victory proffering a wreath. Around part of the circumference of the medallion is the motto: \"Unite Indivisibilite de la Republique.\" Designed for the French Revolution.",

    "gallery_text": "This wallpaper from the French Revolution was woodblock-printed ca. 1792. The Citizens of France felt that the Revolution could not be won just by fighting in political circles or on the battlefield. They thought it also had to occur in the ordinary citizen\u2019s everyday life. It was believed that symbols had a powerful effect on the spirit and could reinforce the validity of the new principles. The domestic nature of wallpaper as well its repetitive aspect made it an ideal medium for portraying such motifs, and bringing these ideals into the home. This paper contains numerous symbols of the Revolution including the red Phrygian or liberty cap, tricolor ribbons, and the motto \"Unite, Indivisibilite de la Republique\", which are all combined in this rather beautiful format. Unlike posters or flyers used today for the spread of information, these are block-printed wallpapers, made by some of the top French manufacturers. These Revolutions papers must have been fairly widely printed and used as the Museum collection contains about a dozen different versions of these papers in both sidewalls and borders.",
