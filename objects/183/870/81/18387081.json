    "description":"A corridor, one hundred and sixty-two feet long, comprises the central promenade of the Brighton Pavilion. It is lighted by a large painted glass skylight which personifies Lin-Shin, the god of thunder. Chinese lanterns are hung from standards along the sides of the room. The walls are covered in peach linen, painted with a bamboo and bird design in blue. The carpet repeats the blue and peach decorative scheme. Large Chinese figures in costume are placed in niches flanking the chimneypiece. Along the walls, bamboo cabinets hung with pink silk panels; fretwork trellises delineating sections of the corridor; and Chinese porcelains complete the chinoiserie interior. A double staircase is seen at the end of the gallery; an identical staircase (not seen) is at the other end.",
