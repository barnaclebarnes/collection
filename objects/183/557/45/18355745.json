A tower rises over a portico, which is flanked by two wings with small windows, in the central section. Domed wings project obliquely; two are suggested on each side. The connections between the wings are lower sections, over which obelisks are to rise. Bottom: the central section and two wings at left, in heavier proportions than above.",
