    "gallery_text": "This engraving shows a decorated ewer whose fantastical design is composed of a large snail shell, snakes, a dragon and four bearded men. It is a plate from a suite of 21 designs for vases with grotesque decorations, printed in 1548 by the Antwerp publisher Hieronymous Cock. The preparatory drawings for the prints do not survive. Between the years of 1548 and 1557, Floris produced several collections of ornamental engravings, many featuring novel and complex arrangements of strapwork and grotesques. Beginning in the mid-sixteenth century, northern European artists competed to produce designs for bizarre and inventive table vessels. These could be made from precious metals, although many remained as exercises in imagination. Ornament prints like these were copied by artisans working in different media, and were responsible for disseminating various decorative styles. Floris was a Flemish sculptor, engraver and architect who traveled to Rome sometime in the 1530\u2019s and 40\u2019s, where he was exposed to grotesque motifs through new archeological discoveries as well as contemporary Italian design. Upon return to Flanders, his workshop contributed significantly to the Northern Renaissance by producing work in the exuberant Italian Mannerist style.",
