    "description": "Pleated folding fan with a paper leaf, printed with a chromolithographic design and pasted with spangles. The obverse shows a bullfighting scene in the center; to the left is a dance scene of the 18th century, and to the right a dance scene of the 19th century. The reverse is red paper. Wood sticks are stained red, varnished and have gilt ornament.",

    "gallery_text": "Folding fans, or abanicos, were considered must-have accessories in nineteenth century Spain. For women, they served as important tools in courtship, the \u2018language of the fan\u2019 expressing everything from \u2018come hither\u2019 to \u2018don\u2019t bother\u2019 to hopeful admirers. The imagery painted or printed on fans also carried important messages. Many celebrate national events, such as the signing of the constitution in 1812, or aspects of Spanish culture. This fan, lithographed with pasted spangles, features both bullfighting and dancing scenes, perhaps suggesting parallels between the two. \n \nThe dancing scene on the left, labeled \u2018eighteenth century,\u2019 is evidently more debauched than its counterpart, with bottles at the guitarist\u2019s feet and the dancers holding hands. The scene on the right, labeled \u2018nineteenth century,\u2019 is more refined, with a female guitarist and the couple at a demure distance, perhaps suggesting the increasing sophistication of Spanish culture. Bullfighting scenes were common on souvenir fans, and this fan may have been made for the tourist market, which was buoyed by the 1875 opera Carmen and the publication of numerous travelers\u2019 guide books.",
