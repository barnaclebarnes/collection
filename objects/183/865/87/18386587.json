    "description": "Man's nightcap with a rounded crown and turned-up brim. The fabric has a green silk satin ground with a woven pattern of flowers and arabesques in cream silk. The brim uses a different section of the same fabric, patterned with rabbits, fruit, trees, and addorsed birds.  Touches of salmon and silver embroidery accent both areas.",

    "gallery_text": "The intricate patterns on this cap precisely fit its shape, suggesting that the fabric was woven specifically for this purpose. Most likely produced professionally, the weaving, embroidery, and tailoring of caps such as this would have been completed in separate workshops.\n \nWigs were common among men of many different social classes in eighteenth century France, and caps were often worn to cover their shaved heads when the wigs were removed. They were often worn for solitary work, such as writing, or before the wig was donned at a masculine toilette. Although primarily a feminine activity, some elite men practiced the ritual of the toilette, at which they received family members, business associates, and other intimates while attendants helped them prepare their wigs and dress for the day.",
