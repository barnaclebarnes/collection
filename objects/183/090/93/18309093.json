    "gallery_text": "Two delicate roses nestle on a creamy ground. Although drawn in grisailles, a monochromatic pallet of grays and black, the flowers achieve an astonishing realism. Anne Vallayer-Coster was a master at painstakingly applying fine washes of ink with small brushes to create lifelike tones in her work. This drawing was among those printed by the engraver Louis-Jean Allais in gravure au pointill\u00e9, a time-consuming technique that could sensitively reproduce the tonal variations of the original. Prints were a popular source for craftspeople who could apply published designs to ceramics, silver and other decorative objects. Vallayer-Coster would make careful botanical studies in preparation for her still life paintings, sophisticated compositions which garnered her great prestige and attracted the patronage of Marie Antoinette. The queen was a great lover of flowers, particularly roses which were a traditional Hapsburg symbol, and until late in her reign was known to adorn herself with fresh blooms. Flowers and other biological motifs reflected popular interest in the natural sciences and are deeply associated with the Rococo, a style which has aptly been described as the final flowering of the Baroque. This drawing combines the precision of scientific illustration with an aesthetic elegance. An artist of great skill, Vallayer-Coster achieved an exceptionally high status for a female artist and, in 1770, was admitted to the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. Her prolific output contributed to the rising esteem of the still life genre in France, and secures her place as a master of eighteenth century naturalism.",
