    "description": "Vertical rectangle. Left row: the three frames are surrounded by two crossed branches. The curtains hang from a pole. Center: in the general shape of an altar with gaines having masks in capitals supporting the entablature. A flower bowl and spirals are on top. The three portraits are supported by crossed branches. Bottom: the portraits hang in front of the tent-curtain. They are connected by ropes or garlands. The lower ones are supported by half-figures standing with their fishtail legs upon a pedestal. Only the left figure is shown. At right the left side is shown. A curtain is suspended in front of an angular niche. In front of it is in the center above an ovoidal frame which two winged half-figures of putti support who spring from the ends of rinceaux. Festoons hang from the frame to blossoms at the ends of spirals. From the blossoms hang ovoidal medallions; in the left one the half-figure of a bearded warrior is shown. Colored background.",
