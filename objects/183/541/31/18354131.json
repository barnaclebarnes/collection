    "gallery_text": "American textile collector and designer, Herman A. Elsberg (1869\u20131938), owned a successful textile manufacturing business in Lyon, France during the early part of the twentieth century. He inhabited two worlds \u2013 that of the collector of historic textiles who published articles and lent important pieces for exhibition, and the other, where he designed and produced fine textiles for fashion and interiors. His depth of knowledge gave him great respect and admiration for the continuing traditions and craftsmanship upheld by the weavers of Lyon. His close ties to France afforded him early exposure to the influence of Art Deco design, and he soon expressed its aesthetics using his Lyonnais weavers, and through his offices in New York, imported his textiles to the United States. Many of his patterns for ribbons and fabrics maintain a harmonious balance between static geometric shapes and the swirling organic lines of plant-like forms. An inventive use of brilliant color and a generous amount of metallic thread only heightened the overall impact of Elsberg\u2019s designs during this period.",
