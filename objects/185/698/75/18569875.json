    "description":"Vertical sheet illustrating scaled drawings of a door and its hardware from the Salle des Etats.  The door is drawn at lower left.  It has three large strap hinges, and a latch which have been executed in watercolor.  Above is a detail of a scrolling metal rest for the door latch, seen from the side and from the front.  To the right of this is a drawing of the latch in plan, with one of its finials also executed in profile above.  To the right of this is one of the strap hinges with four decorative rosette nailheads.  Both the latch and hinge terminate in a fleur-de-lys.  These elements are also drawn perpendicular to the door so as to fit on the page.  At bottom right is one of the nailheads seen in plan, rendered full size.",
