    "description":"Vertical sheet divided into an upper and lower half. The upper half depicts architectural elements from buildings in Orleans, while the lower half illustrates an example of an iron door latch and detail of its finial.  At upper left is a canopied well head, its round basin seen with a hand crank on the left for raising and lowering a basket into the well.  The canopy above is ogee-formed with a small finial above, and supported by two ironwork brackets on either side.  The drawing at right shows an arched door opening with a projecting cornice above supported by a herm in the Mannerist style, shown in profile to the right.  Below center is a ironwork latch rendered in 1\/2 scale, made of flat pieces of iron side by side ending at top and bottom with double fleur-de-lys finials.  To the right is a full-size detail of the finial element, and to the left, a profile of the latch's knob. Slotted, flat-head screws are used throughout.",
