    "description":"Vertical sheet depicting a Roman trireme (warship).  The upper half of the sheet depicts the bow of the ship, with a tall angular hull with a pointed, curved prow, similar to a duck's bill.  The upper section is crenellated, projecting over the port side of the hull, upon which has been painted a fierce eye and brown.  Further behind this is a deck opening enclosed by a cross-beam railing.  The hull has small portholes, and three oars visible below.  To the firth of this is a sketch of the masthead.  The lower half of the sheet shows the ship's stern which curves up and over the top of the end of the ship.  There is another opening to the deck enclosed by a cross-timbered railing with oars projecting from the wooden hull below.  To the right of this is a small sketch of the interior of the ship, depicting in section the dugout-like seats for the rowers.",
