    "description":"Vertical sheet with five sketches of buildings and architectural elements.  Clockwise from top right is a tiled dormer from Loches. Below this is a small open belfry with a narrow, pitched roof supported on two narrow posts, also from Loches.  Below this is a masonry belfry attached to a round turret supported by stone modillions below.  A bell is visible in the belfry, and it is topped by a cupola with finial flying a flag.  To the left of this is portion of a fa\u00e7ade elevation of a masonry building in a late Renaissance style.  The elevation consists of four stories, each of which has a double arcade (door openings at the ground level with windows repeated in the arcade above).  Above this sketch is the elevation of a building exterior with a portico at the second floor from which descends a curved masonry staircase to the ground below.",
