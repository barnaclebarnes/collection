    "description":"Square sheet that has been cut down to this size.  Illustrated at top center is a section of cresting from the roof of the chapel of the Ch\u00e2teau de Blois.  The cresting consists of fleurs-de-lys in blue and gold.  The end of the cresting terminates in a blue and gold finial with decorative metal floral elements springing from the top.  To the right of this is another sketch of decorative metalwork from Blois from a finial on the square tower of the ch\u00e2teau.  The finial has an octagonal base in blue with gold leaves.  Two seahorses are at either side, with a gold flame-like finial at the top.  To the far left is another section of cresting, this time from the roof of the left tower at Ch\u00e2teau de Blois.  This cresting has sections of metal that create an x-shape, from which small crockets spring.  Above are gold fleurs-de-lys.  This cresting also ends in a finial with an urn with seahorses for handles, a crown above, and a small banner with three fleurs-de-lys with a crown above, and a final fleur-de-lys at the top of the finial.  The roof of both the chapel and this tower are visible, and both have rows of painted yellow fleurs-de-lys.",
