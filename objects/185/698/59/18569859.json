    "description":"Vertical sheet illustrating architectural features from the town of Poissy.  At left is a Gothic tower over the crossing of the church of Collegiale Notre-Dame.  It is in an early Gothic style, heavy with masonry.  The tower rises behind the semicircular apse at the lower level, with an octagonal cupola above.  The cupola has double round-arched openings at the carndinal points, and single arches at the ordinal points.  Each opening has louvers.  Above this rises an octagonal roof and finial.  Above right is the picturesque roofline of another building.  It has two chimneys at different heights, a steeply pitched roof in the front, and a tower to the left with an ogee cupola above. Below right is a very small sketch of a window, dormer and chimney from an unidentified building.",
