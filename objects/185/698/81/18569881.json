    "description":"Vertical sheet illustrating part of a wood framed, leaded glass window.  The leading is patterned with rows of faceted rectangles that have been faintly tinted yellowish green to indicate their opacity.  These are separated by small diamond-shaped panes of glass upon which have been painted (likely in yellow- and silver stain) fleurs-de-lys and a small brown symbol. In the center is a roundel of blue glass that frames a porcupine facing left with a crown above.  Around this field is a double border of decorative glass panes.  The outermost border is of yellow guilloche which is intersected by another border of red glass.  Rendered at bottom left of the frame is a flat decorative hinge that has pierced openings in the shape of a heart.  On the right side of the frame is a pierced bar latch to close the window.",
