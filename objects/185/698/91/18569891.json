    "description":"Vertical sheet illustrating a balcony, an example of one of its balusters, and profiles of three different moldings.  The balcony consists of three sections: a a balustrade of three balusters alternating with a short column with an engaged half-baluster; a row of alternating carved rectangular and blind vertical panels, and molding course below. There is a small semicircular projection of the balcony out from the center, below which are curved brackets and a small finial. The baluster is created by inverting two gadrooned vases, the upper smaller than the one below.  In the bottom half of the sheet is a scale drawing in graphite only, possibly illustrating short engaged columns with ornament.   This drawing seems to be perpendicular to the one above.",
