    "description": "Vertical sheet consisting of six sketches.  Beginning at top right are two small sketches of dormers.  The upper example is seen from below and covers a shuttered window.  The dormer element ends in a three-sided projection with decorative metalwork cresting at the joints topped with a tall finial above.  The lower example is viewed from teh front and it has a projecting pyramidal overhang, topped by a spike finial, similar to a lightening rod.  Below this is a sketch of the arms of the town of Hoorn: a unicorn with its head turned to its left, rearing up on the legs of a gargoyle clutching in its hooves a shield with curled sides.  At bottom right is a sketch of a double gable masonry house, its 'trapgevel' fa\u00e7ade punctuated by iron rod ends to support the stones.   At left is a small lookout tower seen from below.  The side of this structure has three windows, ending in a drop finial.  Above left  is the Hospital of Hoorn, a tall masonry building with its fa\u00e7ade articulated by five levels with stepped ends and scrolling ornament.  The window and entrance openings at the ground level are defined by quoins.  There is a Palladian window at the center above the entrance flanked by single round-arched windows on either side.  There are four smaller quare shuttered openings; the one at the building's far left has a small lantern projecting from a bracket.  The window scheme of the upper stories is similar but a triangular pediment is substituted over the windows.  The building bears a date plaque of 1563.  To the building's far right is a smaller, simpler three-story building bearing a date plaque of 1723.",
