    "description": "Horizontal sheet tipped vertically into binding depicting an elaborate black ironwork railing, as the artist notes, is from an altar.   At left the railing begins with a thick square post decorated with very small gold quatrefoils (possibly blind?), and terminates in a tall post that emerges from what the artist calls a \"sort of serpents head,\" and is capped by a ball finial.  The decorative frieze of the railing adjacent to the post is in the shape of repeated figure 8, which trails into a single rod of metal that makes large scrolls (according to the artist's notation, this is \"12 in\".  The scrolls regularly terminate in the head of either a dolphin or a parrot.  The scrollwork meets what is likely the center of the railing where the letters IHS painted golden yellow are inscribed in two confronted scrolls that create the shape of a heart.  Beyond this the scrollwork is only rendered faintly with watercolor to indicate the railing's continuation.  Below this are two sets of ironwork of the same pattern, a heart shape similar to that in the section of railing above, although only scrolling and foliate elements highlighted in gold are contained therein.",
