    "description": "Vertical sheet depicting two sketches drawn at Haarlem.  At left is a tall, narrow steeple on top of a square tower.  The tower is masonry in an earlier Romanesque or Gothic style, with two louvered lancets visible with a blind arcade above.  The tower corners are topped with crockets which are connected by slender (possibly iron) supports.  From this base rises an octagonal clock tower in a more fully executed Gothic or late Gothic style. It can be divided into four levels: at the bottom, a flamboyent Gothic tracery opening at each side; above this, another openwork lancet gallery with crockets at the corners; finally, a blind arcade with small cupola surmounted by a crocketed, opework onion dome with spike and ball finial.   The other sketch at right, as noted by the artist, is a \"balcony or gallery \/ on the hotel de ville \/ Haarlem\". The rectangular gallery has a small balustrade which supports five Ionic columns upon which sits a deep and heavy cornice.  The gallery is supported from below by five scrolling modillions.  The artist notes the \"modillion\" molding \"supporting the\" cornice's \"overhang\", and that the columns have \"good Ionic proportions\".",
