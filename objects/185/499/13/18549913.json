Upper register, garlands are suspended from a large mask which is flanked by open scrolls; central register, two male nudes (slave figures in the style of Michelangelo) rest neatly within each curving concave side of the base flanking a framed central oval medalion; lower register, volutes and lion paws with the Farnese crest at center. The left half of the sheet is more finished.  \n\nVerso: Figures in a tondo. Left foreground, the Madonna is shown seated supporting the dead Christ in her lap;  right foreground,  the Madgalene kneels beside the Madonna behind which an unidentified figure stands. Left background, the Cross is faintly suggested. Upper edge of tondo, angels heads.",

    "gallery_text": "In 1671, the papal nephew Cardinal Francesco Barberini commissioned Carlo Spagna to create four candlesticks for the high altar of Saint Peter's, Rome. These were designed to coordinate with an existing cross and pair of candlesticks made in 1578 by Antonio Gentili, from silver that once composed Charlemagne\u2019s cross. Expansion of the alter garniture was necessary to increase its visibility beneath the showy new baldacchino that Bernini had designed for the high alter. Spagna made this drawing to familiarize himself with the appearance and structure of Gentile\u2019s design. He raised the crucifix by inserting two bands of ornament featuring the heraldic Barberini bees. His candlestick designs closely follow the Gentile silhouette, including sensually straining figures inspired by Michelangelo Buonarroti\u2019s sculptures of slaves. Today, the entire group of seven objects are normally found in the Vatican Treasury and are used only on rare occasions.",
