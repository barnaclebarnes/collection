    "description":"Horizontal sheet folded vertically to create two faces of drawing space.  The sheet has been tipped into the binding so that the interior surfaces are read upside down.  The left sheet (when read correctly) contains the profile of a molded base consisting of multiple types: laurel, leaf and dart, and lozenge.  Below this is a square panel with inset carving inscribed in a circle.  The sheet at right consists of a profile of the base of a pilaster above, and detail of an architrave below.  The architrave has an elaborate griffon and scrollwork frieze.  The verso of the right sheet (read upside down) contains the plan of an octagonal well with steps radiating outward. The upper part of this sheet has been cut off but a sketch of a band of carving remains. The verso of the left sheet (also read upside down) contains an elevation of a rectangular reservoir with a plaque that reads G R A and terminates in a large carved shell above.  The plaque just mentioned is rendered larger to the right of this drawing.",
