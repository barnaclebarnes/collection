    "description":"Vertical sheet tipped horizontally into binding consisting mainly of inscriptions and a few small sketches.  At center left is a plan view of an arcade supported by three columns.  To the right of this is a small column supporting an architrave and rendered separately below it is the base of the same column, its dimensions included as well.  At bottom left is another molding profile.  The verso contains a similarly high ratio of inscriptions to sketches.  At the very top of the sheet is a small, square plan, and to the right of it a view in plan of a span supported by a composition of double colonettes and a single colonette. The rest of the sheet below this contains inscriptions.",
