    "gallery_text": "The 1939 World\u2019s Fair at Flushing Meadows Park in Queens was themed the \u2018World of Tomorrow.\u2019 Visitors came away with visions of radio-controlled highways, mechanical milking machines, and the 7-foot-tall Westinghouse robot. Many also left with Fair memorabilia, from the pins given away at the Futurama exhibition that read \u2018I have seen the future,\u2019 to more costly souvenirs, such as silver spoons, porcelain dishes, and the silk handkerchief featured here.\n \nPrinted in orange, green, and brown on a yellow ground, this handkerchief illustrates several of the Fair\u2019s most celebrated structures. On the left is the Fountain Lake Amphitheatre, and on the right is the famous Heinz dome. In the central medallion are the 610-foot tall Trylon and 200-foot wide Perisphere, an exhibition building that housed a model city designed by Henry Dreyfuss. These structures formed the focal point of the fair\u2019s central promenade, and were reproduced by the millions on Fair memorabilia.",
