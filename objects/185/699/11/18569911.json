The buildings have three stories, each hanging a little further over the one below, topped by a steeply pitched roof concealing an attic space with dormered windows.  The roof gables are filled in with wood creating a pointed arch that has some depth and shadow behind it.  Each story has floor beams visible, projecting out from beyond the building's walls.  A small commercial space is at street level, its sign on both sides reading \"L. Nouil Cirier.\"  There are two figures walking along side the building, which provides a scale for the building's height.",
