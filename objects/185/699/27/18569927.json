    "description":"Vertical sheet illustrating an elevation of a three-story house seen from from a secondary side.  Visible are a masonry ashlar ground floor level that has a wooden arched doorway into a garage or stable with a green door to its left. To the right are stairs from the cobbled street up to the first floor.   The upper two stories are likely also masonry with a plastered finish in a creamy yellow shade.  The elevation has four window openings, and each is framed by irregular blocks of white stone.  To the left of a large window is what seems to be a sundial placed in teh building's fa\u00e7ade.  The roof has a low, flat pitch and projects far out from the walls beneath.  The rear of the building at left seems to have another wing as its tiled roof can be seen.  To the right is the indication of a patio at the first floor level, as small plants and screening shrubs are seen.",
