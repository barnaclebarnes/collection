    "description": "A promotional panel for a silk weaving company from Lyon has a fully-rigged ship on black ground. The three masts carry the flags of Germany, France and the United States while a gold seated figure on the stern holds the flag of the British Empire. Below the ship is a modified coat of arms of Lyon, which shows a rampant lion holding a sword. Above the lion are three bees, perhaps a reference to Napoleon's support for the silk weaving industry of the region. The coat of arms is festooned with a leafy garland and swirling ribbon with the inscription: \"Lyon Travail, Commerce, Industrie, Union, France.\" Below is another inscription: \"Tapissier Fils & Debry.\"",
