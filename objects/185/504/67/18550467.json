    "description": "Vertical format; standing in a park; it consists of a fluted monumental column of Doric style, with a genius raising a torch with her right hand and holding a torch in her left hand; two lateral groups, with a genius standing in front of a panopoly and pointing at a scroll across one of the shields - that at left bears the inscription: A GRAVINA; that at right: A ESCANO. Column and groups stand upon a terrace to which steps lead; the groups have angular pedestals; the column rises above a broad and high base, having a door in the center and a frieze, representing at left, the reception of a warlord by savages, at right the reception of a lady; upon a narrower base, around the pedestal of the column, are the figures of three women; the one at the front holds a paper sword, the one at right, probably a sword, the one at front wares a helmet and is surrounded by unidentified elements.
