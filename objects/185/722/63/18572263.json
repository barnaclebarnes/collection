Leather papers were a high-end wallpaper popular beginning in the late 19th century, with a renewed interest during the Colonial Revival periodt in the early 20th century.\nFounded in 1834, the Birge Company was the oldest existing wallpaper company in America when the company was sold to a Canadian concern in 1959. Receiving much accolade for their imitation leather papers, Birge produced these papers in both historic and contemporary styling. They also worked in actual leather if requested by a client. Leather papers were expensive because they were essentially a handmade product. The paper support was necessarily a very substantial weight to withstand the embossing. The papers are block-printed, then embossed, then antiqued or glazed by hand with an oil color.",
