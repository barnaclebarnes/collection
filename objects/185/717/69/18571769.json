Surrounded by palm trees and exotic foliage. Printed in blue and brown on an ivory ground.",

    "gallery_text": "Resaca de la Palma was the site of an early battle in what became the U.S. \u2013 Mexico War. In March of 1846, the U.S. army under General Zachary Taylor established a fort on the northern banks of the Rio Grande, claiming the river as the southern boundary of the newly annexed state of Texas. Mexico had placed the boundary at the Nueces River, far to the north. There followed weeks of fighting between Taylor\u2019s forces and those of Mexican general Mariano Arista. Mexican leaders believed they were defending Mexican territory, yet the result was that President Polk declared war on Mexico, claiming that American soldiers had been killed \"on American soil.\" \nThe two-year struggle eventually established the Rio Grande as the international border, and today Resaca de la Palma is in Brownsville, Texas. The treaty at the end of the war granted U.S. citizenship to Mexicans occupying the disputed territory, and while some left, many remained and became Mexican-Americans. Both generals Taylor and Arista went on to serve as presidents of their countries.",
