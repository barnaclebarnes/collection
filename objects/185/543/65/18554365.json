    "gallery_text": "The stomacher, an important part of a women's fashion in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, was a triangular panel of fabric worn on the front of the body, attached to the bodice of a dress with ribbon tabs and pins. Gowns were constructed so that the ornamental stomacher panel could be changed for different occasions and styles. The overall effect was to emphasize a narrow feminine waist. Due to their prominent position, stomachers were often highly decorative and made of a material that contrasted with the dress\u2019s main fabric. This extravagant design for a stomacher, with its rich visual pattern and profusion of jewels, could only have been actualized for the wealthiest of clients. Although many designs for stomachers are known, most are for embroidery. Embroiderers could use silk and metal threads to resemble jewels, however the exactitude of this carefully executed pen and ink drawing closely resembles Italian jewelry designs, particularly in the precise faceting of the densely arranged diamonds. The designer, while operating a distinctly separate trade from the embroiderer or jeweler, would require good knowledge of how the work would be executed. This accounts for the drawing\u2019s extreme clarity and minute details.",
