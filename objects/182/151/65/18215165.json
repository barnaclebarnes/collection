    "gallery_text": "During the first decades of the eighteenth century, the workshop of Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle produced several desks with elaborate marquetry and gilt bronze mounts. Although luxury items, many were produced as non-commissioned pieces, indicating that there was a ready market for this type of furniture. In 1720, one desk with a flat top (bureau plat), now at the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, was made for Philippe II, the Duke of Bourbon. As the regent\u2019s chief architect, Gilles-Marie Oppenord would presumably have been involved in arranging the commission and may have produced this drawing after Boulle\u2019s design for his own records. The summary treatment of the ornament in this chalk drawing prevents it from functioning as a working design drawing, nor does it have the inspired urgency of a preparatory sketch. However, it is precise enough to provide a record of the desk\u2019s graceful silhouette and rich ornaments.",
