    "gallery_text": "Percier and Fontaine established their reputations as designers during the Napoleonic Empire. They had met while students in France and had both attended the French Academy in Rome. When Napoleon emerged as emperor in 1804, the pair was designated as official architects and produced works for royal residences and public monuments. Percier and Fontaine developed a unique classical revival style that has since come to be designated as \u201cEmpire.\u201d Their meticulously executed drawings drew on an encyclopedic vocabulary of ancient Greek and Roman motifs. The partners published numerous volumes of their designs. The Recueil de d\u00e9corations int\u00e9rieures was an ambitious project, illustrating all aspects of interior decoration, including furniture, silver, bronzes, and textiles. In the book\u2019s title, the phrase \u201cinterior design\u201d appeared in print for the first time. Initially published in serial installments beginning in 1801, the designs were reissued as a book in 1812. Since very few complete interiors from this time survive, the book provides significant insight into the total decorative schemes of the period. The publication was enormously influential, impacting the English Regency style and American Neoclassicism.",
