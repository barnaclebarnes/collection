    "gallery_text": "This intricately embroidered pi\u00f1a cloth camisa from the Philippines is a testament to the unique textile traditions of this former Spanish colony. Pi\u00f1a cloth is made from the leaves of the pineapple plant (specifically the Red Spanish variety) that are grown and cultivated in the Visayan region of the Philippines. The leaves are hand-stripped to reveal gossamer-thin fibers that are painstakingly hand-knotted to create longer filaments for weaving.  The weaving of pi\u00f1a threads is an equally lengthy process due to the almost microscopic diameter of the fibers and warping the loom can take up to twenty days. These delicate fibers cannot withstand power looms; handlooms with foot-operated treadles must be used. \n \nDue to the laborious cultivation, extraction and production processes involved in making pi\u00f1a cloth, the fabric was primarily enjoyed by the upper classes. During the nineteenth century, the traditional costume for well-to-do women comprised of the camisa and the panuelo, (an embroidered scarf also made of pi\u00f1a cloth worn over the shoulders), over full western-style skirts enhanced by petticoats. Today, pi\u00f1a is largely reserved for special occasions, such as high society events and government functions.",
