    "description": "Design for two chandeliers.  Left, is a chandelier with a lyre as the shaft.  Branches of bottom row of candle shafts form French horns and top branches of candle shafts form flower boughs.  Right, is a chandelier with the shaft formed by four children standing on fantastic birds, which, in turn, stand on a sphere.  Sockets for candles are placed in the children's hands and on the heads of the birds.",

    "gallery_text": "This highly finished watercolor presents a design for two double-tiered chandeliers by Jean D\u00e9mosth\u00e8ne Dugourc (1749-1825), the French architect who served as a furniture designer to the French crown and later became the first architect to the King of Spain. These chandeliers would have been executed in gilt bronze, porcelain and rock crystal. The left chandelier takes the double-headed eagle topped lyre as the central element. The lower tier of candles are supported by a base inspired by hunting horns and the candleholders in the top level are in the shape of flower boughs.  The right chandelier has a group of four putti as the central shaft. The candleholders in the lower row are in the shape of fantastic birds, perhaps griffins, adorned with crystal drops. The birds in turn rest on an armillary sphere, an early astronomical instrument. The upper level of candles is held by the putti. The largest of the two designs was intended for the Salon de Parade in Comte de Nord\u2019s Palace of Cameno\u00efstrof in Russia. The designs display a fantastic combination of neoclassical motifs, collaged together in service of ornament.",
