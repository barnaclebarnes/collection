    "description": "Black cast iron radiator (b) in the form of a podium surmounted by an arch forming a niche for a standing draped figure (a) of a woman- the goddess Hebe- holding a Greek drinking goblet in either hand (d,e).  A composite entablature is surmounted by a Doric cornice crowned by a semi-circular tympanum.  The podium base is decorated with bas-reliefs of columns alternating with Greek vases surrounded by drapery at the lower level and repeated scene of a griffin and man pouring liquid into a bowl in the upper level.  The arch itself is decorated with bas-reliefs of rosettes and scrolls on two supporting pilasters with fluted capitals.  The tympanum has a bas-relief of an eagle clutching a staff from which springs ribbons bearing \"Stratton\" and Seymour\".  Stars decorate tympanum, following the semi-circular curve.  Radiator stands on four detachable scrolled legs (f\/i).  The fender (c) is comprised of grille work formed by scrolls, acanthus leaves and rosettes.  Flat circular flue key (j) with stylized foliate handle fits on pipe behind tympanum.",

    "gallery_text": "This cast-iron radiator demonstrates both the nineteenth-century taste for classical revival styles and the period's technological advances. The draped central figure, architectural form, and other decorative elements reference ancient Greece. In the new American nation, classical revival styles were widely popular and could be found in a huge range of design types, from architecture to tableware, ennobling utilitarian items with romantic ideals of democracy and cosmopolitanism. The decoration on this radiator, or \"dumb stove,\" follows this fashion on what was then a modern appliance. At the time, some Americans began to replace their wood-burning fireplaces with iron stoves as a central heat source. Just as the hearth before it, the stove would have been a focal point of an elegantly decorated space. The \u201cdumb stove,\u201d which did not have a place to burn coals itself, was usually found on the second floor; a stove pipe connected it to a first-floor working stove that emitted heat. This specific example was previously installed in a mansion owned by Eugene Keteltas, a member of an established New York family, on the corner of then\u2013fashionable and wealthy lower Second Avenue and St. Mark's Place.",
    "label_text": "Edith Wetmore, a close friend of the Hewitt sisters, provided this radiator from her family\u2019s New York house. As a utilitarian object and an architectural sculpture with references to classical antiquity, its design enabled the oversize heat source to be featured openly in the increasingly lavish and comfortable interiors of the 19th century.",
