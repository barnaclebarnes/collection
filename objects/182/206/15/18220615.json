    "gallery_text": "This design for a folding screen panel by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher is an homage to the rustic and the rural. It was etched and engraved as part of a series of folding screen designs. In Boucher\u2019s design, a shepherd crowns a shepherdess with a floral wreath. The two figures rest on an oversized pedestal ornamented by two putti. In the recess are broken columns and ruined temples that serve as vanitas (mortality) motifs. There is a sense of rustic playfulness and the Italianate trees in the background presents the scene as a Georgic fantasy. The design is framed by scrolling vines and garlands topped with a pagoda motif. Indolent shepherdesses and picturesque ruins are themes that appear throughout Boucher\u2019s prints and paintings. Here, Boucher has merged his artistic predilections in the service of ornament. While folding screens based on his designs were probably never realized, Boucher, along with artists such as Antoine Watteau, Claude Audran, Jacques de Lajo\u00fce, and Nicolas Lancret, designed panels for folding screens, particularly as the latter became a ubiquitous part of French interior furnishings from the late seventeenth-century onwards.",
