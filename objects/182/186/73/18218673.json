    "gallery_text": "This neatly colored drawing was likely made to present a client with a variety of options for chair designs. Traditionally, when a designer received a commission for a piece of furniture, they would begin with a quick sketch, which would be developed into a more detailed study and finally, a tidy presentation drawing. Like many artists, Jean-D\u00e9mosth\u00e8ne Dugourc kept an album of his work to show prospective patrons. The illustrative format of three chairs grouped in differing profiles on a creamy white ground was typical of contemporary English pattern books. In the late eighteenth century, Anglomania was widespread among the wealthy in France. Many French designers were influenced by their English counterparts working in the new \u201cEtruscan\u201d style. This decorative repertoire of classicizing ornament was inspired by antiquities being rediscovered on Italian peninsula.The parrot armchair in the presentation drawing appears to have elements made of verde antique, bronze contrived to look old by the application of a green patina. However, an extant chair made after Dugourc\u2019s design by the carpenter George Jacob is made of painted mahogany.",
