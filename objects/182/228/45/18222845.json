    "description": "The tureens are the visual elements for the crowning figures of the surtout.  The shape of the lid of the tureens is adapted from the form of a sea-shell, upon which the animals and vegetables are placed to harmonize with the oval tureen and its plateau.  The plateau is an asymmetric cartouche; vegetables are integrated into the plateau's undulating border of concave and convex forms.",

    "gallery_text": "This print is a view of tureen and a table center piece designed by Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier for Evelyn Pierrepont, Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull in the 1730s. Meissonnier was a French architect and designer who worked for the Louis XV in the early eighteenth-century. The tureens and the surtout (table centerpiece) are prime examples of the rococo style, which had been contemporaneously called the \"genre pittoresque.\" The surtout is composed of sinuous foliate ornaments and playful putti with two cruets for oil and vinegar. The tureen is in the shape of a shell with incrustations and is ornamented with casts of celery roots, onion, carrots, cabbage leaves. The lid features a partridge, crayfish, mushroom and a turnip. The tureens are in fact mirror images of each other and together with the centerpiece, would have been part of a formal meal service. This tureen and another with a different lid were realized in solid silver through the lost wax casting method from 1734-37 by Meissonnier and the Parisian silversmiths Henri Adnet and Pierre-Francois Bonnestrenne. In the etching, the designs are displayed in an imaginary architectural space typical of Meisonnier\u2019s resplendent rococo interiors that in turn highlights the exuberant ornamentation of the tureens. The Duke of Kingston likely commissioned the tureens after his interest in the new French rococo style was sparked following  his continental Grand Tour during which his attention would have been drawn to Meissonnier who was considered one of the progenitors of this opulent style. This print is an example of how eighteenth-century French artists and artisans designed for elite foreign patrons and, in turn, used such projects as platforms to advance and disseminate their own artistic styles.",
