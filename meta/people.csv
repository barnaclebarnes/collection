"Byung-Hoon Choi is a pioneer of sculptural art furniture design in his native Korea.  Choi strives to create works of design that transcend the traditional boundaries of functionality, while simultaneously evoking Korean cultural symbols.  He was one of several artist/designers who promoted a modern approach to traditional Korean furniture in the second half of the 20th century.  Choi often uses seemingly contradictory shapes or materials in a single design, but he employs stone, a signature element, to establish a unity and tranquility within each work.  His designs are often derived from nature, incorporating the natural world through both material and form.  His work is included in the collections of a number of institutions in South Korea, including the National Museum of Contemporary Art, Seoul and the Seoul Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as in the Vitra Design Museum, Weil am Rhein, Germany.",,,1,"Korean, b. 1952",,35518607,,,,,,Byung-Hoon Choi,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35518607/,,,,,,
"Born in Long Beach, California, metalworker Forrest Myers studied at the San Francisco Art Institute, where he was inspired by the wire sculpture of Alexander Calder as well as the jazz of Ornette Coleman. In 1961, he moved to New York and joined a number of innovative artists and sculptors (all graduates of the San Francisco Art Institute), including Mark di Suvero, Robert Grosvenor, Ed Ruda, and others, in forming the artists’ cooperative The Park Place Gallery. When Park Place disbanded in 1967, Myers showed his work at the newly formed Paula Cooper Gallery. In 1968, he became a member of Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), a group founded as a laboratory for creative experimentation by the engineers Fred Waldhauer and Billy Kluver with artists Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Witman. Myers was among four members of E.A.T. commissioned to design the Pepsi Cola Pavilion and program at Expo 70 in Osaka, Japan, considered among the most important and influential installations to combine art and technology of the 20th century.  Myers’ most famous work is The Wall, commissioned in 1973 by the public art organization, City Walls (now known as Public Art Fund). The 75 x 100 foot teal blue-painted wall, with projecting green-painted aluminum beams set in a grid pattern, was mounted on the corner of Houston Street and Broadway and became a SoHo icon. Forrest Myers’ sculptures are in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, the Storm King Art Center, and the Virginia Museum of Art.",,,18,"American, b. 1941",,35518601,,,,,,Forrest Myers,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35518601/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Andrea Branzi is an architect, designer, and professor of industrial design, working in the fields of urban planning and cultural promotion. In 1966 Branzi founded the Archizoom Association with partners Paolo Deganello, Gilberto Corretti and Massimo Morozzi. The firm, named after the British group of architects known as Archigram and the journal “Zoom,” was one of the first avant-garde groups associated with the Postmodernist movement in Italy. From its founding until 1974, the team produced work in design, architecture and urban planning that aimed reconciliation between design and the challenges of contemporary society.  Branzi and its members developed plans such as No-Stop City (1970), a radical design vision projecting the city of the future as a “fluid metropolis,” where the individual can creatively and freely achieve his own housing conditions. Archizoom also invented “Superarchitecture,” endorsing unconventional and eclectic design along the lines of Pop Art. In 1983 Branzi cofounded Domus Academy, the first international post-graduate school for design.   He is the author of many books and essays on the theory and history of design, and has collaborated with magazines such as Domus, Interni and Casabella.  His work has been featured in the Venice Biennale and Milan Triennale, and is in the permanent collections of the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, among others.",,,5,"Italian, b. 1938",,35518605,,,,,,Andrea Branzi,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35518605/,,,,,23424853,23424853

"Born in Ferrara, Italy in 1951, Michele de Lucchi studied architecture at the University of Florence, from which he graduated in 1975.  Among a group of architects and designers working in the 1970s and 1980s who were reacting against the “stifling” formalism of the prevailing International Style, Michele de Lucchi joined several radical experimental design groups including Gruppo Cavart and Studio Alchymia, before becoming one of the founding members of the infamous design collective, Memphis, led by Ettore Sottsass.  From 1992 to 2002, Michele de Lucchi was design director for Olivetti and developed experimental projects for such corporate clients as Siemens, Phillips, Compaq Computers, and Vitra.   His product designs for Artemide (Tolomeo and Logico lamp series), Kartell, Matsushita, and Cucine are still celebrated today.  Michele de Lucchi’s architectural commissions include exteriors and interiors for Deutsche Bank, Novartis, Telecom Italia, the Groningen Museum in the Netherlands and the Neues Museum in Berlin.  As an advocate for artisanal production techniques and materials, Michele de Lucchi founded Produzione Privata in 1990 to produce his product designs and works on architecture commissions through his studio aMDL, based in Milan and Rome.",,,2,"Italian, b. 1951",,35518609,,,,,,Michele de Lucchi,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35518609/,,,,,23424853,23424853

"Peter Krider began his apprenticeship with Philadelphia silversmith John Curry in 1835 and finished it there with the more prolific and well-known firm of Robert and William Wilson, where he worked as a journeyman for about 15 months. In about 1842, he moved to Boston, where he worked for Obadiah Rich, returning to Philadephia about four years later to serve as the Wilsons' foreman. His firm, Krider & Co, appears in the Philadelphia directories first in 1851. He ultimately became one of Philadelphia's most important silversmiths of the second half of the nineteenth century.   During most of the time from  1859-1870 , when John W. Biddle was his partner, the firm was known as Krider & Biddle. The business was sold to August Weber in 1888.

"Thomas Heatherwick:  Since founding the Heatherwick Studio in 1994, Thomas Heatherwick has garnered international recognition as one of the most influential and innovative designers today.  Heatherwick’s works span a wide range of disciplines—from architecture, furniture, fashion, and product design to engineering, transportation design, and urban planning—and are executed on a variety of scales.  Born in London in 1970, Heatherwick was introduced to design at an early age by both of his parents.  His mother, a bead collector, helped Heatherwick to develop his aesthetic while his father introduced him to architecture and design.  As a child, Heatherwick frequently worked on inventions, anything from mechanical birthday cards to go-karts. He went on to study 3-D design at Manchester Polytechnic, where he received a degree in 1991, followed by study in a two year Furniture MA program at the Royal Academy of Art, receiving a degree in 1994. Upon graduating, he established the Thomas Heatherwick Studio (now the Heatherwick Studio) where over the last 18 years, he and a group of fellow designers, architects, and engineers have worked on nearly 200 projects. Heatherwick has won various honors and awards, including honorary doctorates from four universities: Sheffield Hallam, Brighton, Dundee, and Manchester Metropolitan University.  Heatherwick is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and is a Senior Fellow at the Royal College of Art.  Additionally, he is the youngest practitioner to be appointed a Royal Designer for Industry.  His works have been exhibited in England and internationally, and most recently the V&A hosted a retrospective of the works of Heatherwick Studio called, “Heatherwick Studio: Designing the Extraordinary.”",,,1,"English, b. 1970",,35459769,,,,,,Thomas Heatherwick,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35459769/,,,,,23424975,23424975

At the age of 30, immediately after graduation, began work for Blenko, June 1947.
Hired as Blenko Glass company's first full-time in house designer; 1947-53.

During his 6 year tenure he created over 160 new designs for Blenko and completely re-shaped their product line.

"Founded by English chemist, William J. Blenko as Eureka Art Glass Company, in Milton, West Virginia in 1921, the Blenko Glass Company assumed its name in 1930.  Blenko understood not only the glass process, but color, a key impact of glass design.  Initially, the firm specialized in plate glass, patenting a ruby red color that could be re-fired for stained glass enamellists.  Blenko introduced tableware in 1929; during the 1930’s it inclined towards a Swedish aesthetic, especially under foreman Carl Ebert Erickson from 1937-42.  In 1947, Blenko hired Winslow Anderson as its first credited full-time, in-house designer.  Anderson (1947-53) at Blenko was succeeded by Wayne Husted (1953-63), Joel Philipi Myers (1963-70), John Nickerson (1970-74), Don Shepherd (1974-88), Hank Adams (1988-94), Matt Carter (1995-2002), Richard Blenko (1980-2007), and Arlen Bayliss (2007-2012) as artistic directors.",,,8,"Milton, West Virginia, 1921 - 2012",,35459779,,,,,,Blenko Glass Company,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35459779/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Philippe Apeloig (b. 1962) is a French graphic designer and typographer.  Apeloig was educated at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Appliqués and the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, where he gained experience in what was then the traditional approach to typography—calligraphy, hand lettering, and metal type.  While still a student, he worked as a intern at the Dutch firm Total Design under the guidance of Daphne Ofreski and Yoleen van der Vouw.  Both Ofreski and van der Vouw were assistants to Total Design founder Wim Crouwel, and they imparted in Apeloig the value of the organizational grid that would become one of the foundations of his personal approach.  Following his graduation, Apeloig worked as a designer for Musée d’Orsay in Paris from 1985 to 1987 before traveling to Los Angeles to work with April Greiman.  Under Greiman’s mentorship, Apeloig was encouraged to embrace emerging technology as a design tool.  He returned to Paris to establish his own studio, and has since taught typography and graphic design at The Cooper Union School of Art in New York and the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris.  Since the late 1980s, Apeloig has produced poster designs and graphic identities for the New York Type Directors Club, FIAF (French Institute / Alliance Francaise) in New York, Instituto Universitario di Architectura di Venezia (IUAV), Musée du Louvre, Association des bibliothécaires de France (ABF), The New York Times T Magazine, the Châtelet Theatre Musical de Paris, Le Maison de Photo, Brittany, and Galerie Litvak, Tel Aviv, among others.

"Born in 1861 in Tallmadge, Ohio, Clara Wolcott Driscoll was among the many young women who flocked to New York City in the late 1800s seeking respectable careers, particularly in the burgeoning field of industrial arts. After graduating from Cleveland's Western Reserve School of Design for Women in 1882, she attended the Metropolitan Museum Art School in New York City and was hired by Tiffany around 1888. In 1892 she was appointed head of the newly-formed Women's Glass Cutting Department, which eventually employed as many as thirty-five women. In addition to managing a large staff, Driscoll was responsible for creating designs for a wide range of objects and, in fact, designed most of the firm's lampshades and mosaic bases.

"The firm of Hemmerle, a fourth-generation family-run atelier based in Munich, Germany, is an innovative high-end jewelry firm with a distinctive approach to its choice of materials. It traces its origins to the late nineteenth century when, in 1893, brothers Joseph and Anton Hemmerle took ownership of an existing Munich jeweler Elchinger, changing the name to Gebruder (or brothers) Hemmerle in the process.  Munich has for centuries been a center of high-quality craftsmanship in gold, silver and jeweled work, a tradition from which Hemmerle emerged.  Hemmerle became renowned for offering traditional jewelry and decorations that were sufficiently technically sophisticated and of high quality and soon thereafter the firm was appointed purveyor to the Royal Bavarian Court.  In this capacity, the firm provided the royal family with military decorations and medals. In 1904, Hemmerle established its boutique and atelier on fashionable Maximilianstrasse in Munich, where it still stands today.

Joseph’s and Anton’s sons, Joseph Jr. and Carl Hemmerle, assumed directorship of the company in 1937 and continued producing the traditional jewels for which Hemmerle enjoyed a strong reputation. In 1971, directorship passed to their sons, Franz and Stefan, and in 1995, Stefan took sole control of Hemmerle with his wife Sylveli. Stefan, a trained goldsmith, became the creative design force behind the firm. He cites as inspirations the unusual mix of nature, the Bauhaus and the Neue Sachlichkeit movement. Under their direction, the firm underwent a major transformation, developing a bold and sometimes understated aesthetic that continues the use of high-quality stones with some surprising mixes of metals and even woods.

The transition started with a commission in 1995 for a prominent Munich art collector. In response to the client’s penchant for Berlin iron jewelry, Stefan Hemmerle set a large white diamond in a base of textured black iron rather than the predictable gold or platinum. The unusual, irreverent combination of a common metal with the brilliance of a precious stone against the textured iron mixed historical and contemporary aesthetic simplicity and bold modernity, becoming a Hemmerle signature. The company has since expanded beyond iron, employing unconventional, provocative materials such as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, brass, rare woods, acorns, river pebbles, and even walrus teeth in creating its architectural settings for exquisitely cut gemstones. 

As of 2012, Stefan and Sylveli Hemmerle run the business with their son, Christian, and daughter-in-law, Egyptian-born Yasmin. Together the family oversees all aspects involved in Hemmerle’s designs. Production at their atelier is annually limited to no more than 350 pieces. A single piece can take up to 500 hours to create, and no two are exactly the same. Hemmerle can be called a haute joaillerie firm as it concentrates on high-quality craftsmanship and stones.  Their innovative techniques and material combinations along with an interest in a modernist aesthetic in design are not often associated with haute joaillerie, but it makes them a creative firm in this field.

"Industrial designer, Jake Dyson, is the son of James Dyson, inventor of the innovative and widely imitated cyclonic vacuum cleaner system of the early 1990s, the lastest versions and variants still in production today. Growing up around an engineer-designer influenced Jake, who chose the same career path and studied Industrial Design at Central St. Martin’s College of Art and Design. He graduated in 1994 and began work designing retail interiors, shops, cafes and clubs. He then set up his own workshop, purchasing a mill and a lathe, and started experimenting and developing products. His studio/workshop, Jake Dyson Products, is based in Clerkenwell in Central London.

Jake has become a specialist in lighting design, and leads a small team of engineers at his studio, focusing their efforts on coming up with new products such as the 2007 Motorlight lamp, the first variable angle up-light, which comes in both floor and wall models. Jake Dyson’s approach is to first conceive of a product, then control all processes from concept to manufacture, rather than separate product design from the development and manufacturing sides. Jake believes that a “hands on” approach to creating prototypes, testing, and subsequently finishing products, is an essential part of the design process.",,,1,"English, born 1972",,35456083,,,,,,Jake Dyson,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35456083/,,,,,23424975,23424975
"Anthony Burrill is a graphic designer based in Oxney, Kent, England.  Born in Littleborough, Lancashire, Burrill studied Graphic Design at Leeds Polytechnic and the Royal College of Art.  Working in print, installation, and moving image, Burrill’s work often features witty yet commonplace slogans set in bold types and bright colors.  Traditional printmaking techniques such as wood block printing, letterpress and screenprint are integral parts of Burrill’s design process and aesthetic.  His commercial practice has included advertising campaigns and posters for The Economist magazine, the British Library, the London Underground, The Design Museum, London, and Colette, Paris.  His work has been exhibited at the Graphic Design Museum at Breda, Kemistry Gallery, London, The Victoria & Albert Museum, London, and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.",,,1,"British, b. 1966",,35456075,,,,,,Anthony Burrill,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/35456075/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"The 47-year old Grcic is recognized for his innovative solutions in designing even the most mundane products, ranging from laundry baskets and kitchen appliances, to furniture, lighting, and more. His approach to design often looks beyond form and function, investigating how an object should work and look in the context of its relationship to the user, and the suitability of materials and fabrication methods for fitness of purpose, durability, cost, and broad availability. 

Trained in England between 1985 and 1989, first in cabinet-making and carpentry, then in furniture design, the work Grcic produced in his first decade of practice reflected his grounding in the spare rational design language of the Modernist tradition. By 1991, after a year working for the English designer Jasper Morrison, Grcic returned to his native Munich, where he opened his own design studio, and by the end of the decade, was experimenting with computer-aided design software, creating more fluid forms while continuing to rethink conventional home products. His later designs often incorporate a wry humor as well.

"In 1950, Hugo Dreyfuss, an artist, textile designer and printmaker, partnered with the furniture designer, Vladimir Kagan, to form Kagan-Dreyfuss, Inc. The two met through the artist Emanuel Romano, the brother of Dreyfuss’s wife, Beatrice Glicenstein. Prior to partnering with Dreyfuss, Kagan’s business was a family operation, with his father overseeing the factory and his mother running the small shop on East 65th Street. Dreyfuss’s investment in the company enabled them to move to a larger, more prestigious location at 125 East 57th Street. Kagan-Dreyfuss expanded their range of products and began producing a catalog. Dreyfuss took particular interest in printed textiles. In addition to hand printing his own designs, Dreyfuss brought in a full-time weaver, Nadia Cheripov, who set up her loom in one of the display windows of the shop. The company also sold the work of Dorothy Liebes and other weavers. In 1960, the partnership was dissolved; Kagan closed the store and reopened at 81st Street and East End Avenue as a trade showroom, and Dreyfuss retired.",,,7,,,68737585,,,,,,Kagan-Dreyfuss Inc.,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68737585/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Jorge Lizarazo is the owner and founder of Hechizoo Textiles (2000), a firm based in Bogota, Colombia. Lizarazo originally worked as an architect, which influences both the structural clarity and materials used in his textiles. His design work also benefits from his staff’s diverse expertise in the rich weaving traditions of multiple South American regions. The staff is trained to work with new and unusual materials that complement the often understated and basic textile structure of the textiles. Often, his designs require that man-made materials such as metal wire, nylon, and polyester ribbon are integrated with natural materials such as, silk, agave, cumare and penca. The result of these types of combinations is textiles that are both contemporary and sophisticated.",,,3,,,68737515,,,,,,Jorge Lizarazo,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68737515/,,,,,23424787,23424787

"An active participant in New York City’s expanding avant garde architecture and arts scene during the early-mid 20th century, architect-designer-theorist, Frederick Kiesler started his career designing exhibition spaces and theater sets in Vienna and Berlin. Kiesler was born in 1890 in Czernowitz, Austro-Hungarian Empire. He enrolled at the Technical University and the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna in 1908-09 to study architecture, but never completed his formal training, instead focusing on set design. After Josef Hoffmann took notice of Kiesler’s designs, he invited him to design a theater display for the Austrian pavilion at the Exposition des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris, advancing Kiesler to the epicenter of avant garde design.

A year later, in 1926, Kiesler and his wife moved to New York City, where they would spend the rest of their lives. Once in New York, Kielser became a founding member of the American Union of Decorative Arts and Craftsmen in 1928. He also worked on a series of important commissions that paralleled a definitive shift in design, transporting it from a realm of sharp, exacting shapes to more irregular, biomorphic forms. Among the commissions were a sitting room for Charles and Marguerite Mergentime and the interior of Peggy Guggenheim’s gallery, Art of This Century.

Kielser taught at Columbia University’s School of Architecture, establishing its Laboratory for Design Correlation in 1937. He was named one of “the 15 leading artists at mid-century” in 1952 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Just before his death in 1965 at the age of 75, Kiesler completed his final commission for the Shrine of the Book, which houses writings significant to Judaism, in Jerusalem.

"The firm of Hemmerle, a fourth-generation family-run atelier based in Munich, Germany, is an innovative high-end jewelry firm with a distinctive approach to its choice of materials. It traces its origins to the late nineteenth century when, in 1893, brothers Joseph and Anton Hemmerle took ownership of an existing Munich jeweler Elchinger, changing the name to Gebrüder (or brothers) Hemmerle in the process.  Munich has for centuries been a center of high quality craftsmanship in gold,silver and jeweled work, a tradition from which Hemmerle emerged.  Hemmerle became renowned for offering traditional jewelry and decorations that were sufficiently technically sophisticated and of high quality that soon thereafter the firm was appointed purveyor to the Royal Bavarian Court.  In this capacity, the firm provided the royal family with military decorations and medals. In 1904, Hemmerle established its boutique and atelier on fashionable Maximilianstrasse in Munich, where it still stands today.

Joseph’s and Anton’s sons, Joseph Jr. and Carl Hemmerle, assumed directorship of the company in 1937 and continued producing the traditional jewels for which Hemmerle enjoyed a strong reputation. In 1971, directorship passed to their sons, Franz and Stefan, and in 1995, Stefan took sole control of Hemmerle with his wife Sylveli. Stefan, a trained goldsmith became the creative design force behind the firm. He cites as inspirations the unusual mix of nature, the Bauhaus and the Neue Sachlichkeit movement. Under their direction, the firm underwent a major transformation, developing a bold and sometimes understated aesthetic that continues the use of high quality stones with some surprising mixes of metals and even woods.

The transition started with a commission in 1995 for a prominent Munich art collector. In response to the client’s penchant for Berlin iron jewelry, Stefan Hemmerle set a large white diamond in a base of textured black iron, rather than the predictable gold or platinum. The unusual, irreverent combination of a common metal with the brilliance of a precious stone against the textured iron mixed historical and contemporary aesthetic simplicity and bold modernity, becoming a Hemmerle signature. The company has since expanded beyond iron, employing unconventional, provocative materials such as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, brass, rare woods, acorns, river pebbles, and even walrus teeth in creating its architectural settings for exquisitely cut gemstones. 

As of 2012, Stefan and Sylveli Hemmerle run the business with their son, Christian, and daughter-in-law, Egyptian-born Yasmin. Together the family oversees all aspects involved in Hemmerle’s designs. Production at their atelier is annually limited to no more than 350 pieces. A single piece can take up to 500 hours to create, and no two are exactly the same. Hemmerle can be called a haute joaillerie firm as it concentrates on high quality craftsmanship and stones.  Their innovative techniques and material combinations along with an interest in a modernist aesthetic in design are not often associated with haute joaillerie, but it makes them an innovative firm in this field.",,,5,"Munich, Germany, founded 1893",,68739355,,,,,,Gebrüder Hemmerle,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68739355/,,,,,23424829,23424829

"Dennis Da Silva (born ca. 1946) began experimenting with gemstone carving and scrimshaw during the Vietnam War while he served in the Navy. Before the war, Da Silva studied sculpture under Heinze Warneke and Don Turano and painting at Maryland University. When he completed his term of service in 1976, Da Silva dedicated his career to mastering a much wider array of media including marble, wood, metals and terra cotta. He also continued painting, gaining prominence for his Civil War-era portraiture. He illustrated the cover of North South Trader magazine in 1973 and many other Civil War books and periodicals followed. Da Silva’s best known works, however, are his wooden architectural models of historic ships like the HMS Titanic and the USS Monitor. Expertly crafted at a 1/4 inch scale, modelmaking allows Da Silva to revisit extraordinary architectural and industrial innovations in the US and abroad.  Da Silva continues to create work from his farm in Frederick County, Maryland.",,,1,"American, b. ca 1946",,68735149,,,,,,Dennis Da Silva,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68735149/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Sulki and Min Choi began collaborating as MFA students in Yale University’s graphic design program. After two years as researchers at the Jan van Eyck Academie in Maastricht, the married team returned to their native South Korea. Since then, they have earned international recognition for their contributions to contemporary design. Their work spans a variety of media, from posters and logos to video and web design. Eager for more control over the subject of their designs, they founded Specter Press in 2006, through which they primarily publish catalogues and monographs, often featuring the work of other Korean artists. Sulki & Min are also members of SMSM, an art collective best known for its interactive installations.

Sulki & Min’s graphic designs for exhibitions, festivals, businesses, and periodicals share a bold typographic sensibility. They create their own fonts and often incorporate in their designs the juxtaposition of the Roman and Hangul alphabets. Bright colors activate their carefully diagrammed compositions. Rather than channel traditional Korean design, the couple finds inspiration in Western modernism, and credits designers like Norman Potter and Anthony Froshaug as major influences. They work together on most of their projects, jointly devising a conceptual strategy.  By their own description Sulki addresses the big-picture concerns, and Min tends to the details.

Sulki & Min had their first exhibition in 2006, at Gallery Factor in Seoul. The Arts Council Korea recognized the show with their Art Award of the Year. Their second exhibition, at Seoul’s Kimjinjye Gallery, was held in 2008. The couple has participated in many group exhibitions, including the Ningbo International Graphic Design Biennale (2008, 2009, and 2010) and Graphic Design: Now in Production, the exhibition co-curated by Ellen Lupton that opened at the Walker Art Center in 2011 and at Cooper Hewitt’s satellite space on Governor’s Island in 2012.

"After a decade in mainstream advertising, Singaporean designer Theseus Chan founded the independent consulting firm, WORK, in 1997. Three years later, he created a sibling publication, Werk magazine. Frustrated by the aesthetic tedium and reserve he perceived at larger ad agencies, Chan used these new ventures to foster innovative design. With WORK, he has devised unconventional new modes of advertising, including “guerrilla” pop-up stores and promotional zines. He draws inspiration from street art to represent his luxury clientele, who include Comme des Garçons and Louis Vuitton. WORK has also designed branding and advertisements for the 2006 Singapore Biennale, Adidas, Uniqlo, and UBS Bank, among others. 

Like Chan’s firm, his magazine, Werk, is known for pushing boundaries. The graphic design publication is printed in small, meticulously crafted editions. Chan experiments with textures, materials, and new binding techniques to produce each issue. He uses  an organic process to design the magazine, and works without a clear idea of the finished product. He prefers to be surprised by the outcome, and to surprise his readers in turn. 

Chan’s designs for WORK and the Werk publication have received accolades from the New York Art Director’s Club, the Tokyo Type Director’s Club, and the Singapore Creative Circle, and he was named Designer of the Year at the inaugural Singapore President’s Design Awards in 2008. Chan acted as Head Juror of Magazine & Newspaper Design at the British Design and Art Director’s Club Awards in 2012. In the same year, Ginza Graphic Gallery exhibited a solo show of his work.",,,1,"Singaporean, b. 1961",,68735135,,,,,,Theseus Chan,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68735135/,,,,,23424948,23424948

"Mark Gowing is a prominent Australian designer best known for his inventive use of typography. His interest in type began in childhood, when his grandfather, a calligrapher and sign-painter, introduced him to the subtle distinctions of lettering and logo design. Gowing was a habitual doodler, and his class notebooks were littered with sketches of iconic logos. Today, he designs brand identities for companies like Hopscotch Films, Title Music, and the Sydney Opera House. Gowing first worked as a designer for a children’s book publisher, where he had interned in high school. The experience provided a practical education in publishing and design practice which he brought to subsequent jobs in magazine design. He has explained that these opportunities granted him more freedom to experiment with typography. 

After twelve years as a full-time designer, Gowing began to reassess his professional goals, and launched his own studio in 1997. A self-described idealist, he emphasizes the importance of “cultural responsibility” in design. He feels that designers are obligated to represent their clients honestly, rather than disguise socially or environmentally destructive corporations with sleek ads and logos. His own work calls attention to issues like sustainability and he cites the Australian environment as a major inspiration for his designs. He explains that the country’s minimalist landscape, with its repeating forms, is manifested in his spare, geometric compositions.

In addition to his work for corporations, Gowing founded an independent music label, called Preservation Music, in 2011. In 2013, he created Formist Publishers, through which he publishes art and design books. Gowing has received solo exhibitions at Dievieto Daffissioni in Torino, Italy (2013), Monash University in Melbourne, Australia (2013), and at the 2010 Warsaw International Poster Biennale. He has also participated in group exhibitions around the world. He is the recipient of many accolades from organizations such as the Graphis Poster Annual, the Australian Graphic Design Association, and the Mexico International Poster Biennale.",,,4,"Australian, b. 1970",,68735181,,,,,,Mark Gowing,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68735181/,,,,,23424748,23424748

"Felix Pfäffli is a young Swiss designer based in Lucerne whose posters are an arresting amalgam of precision and pop. They command attention with vivid colors and inventive, geometric type. Pfäffli’s interest in graphic design began in high school, when he started creating posters and brochures for a local concert house. In this capacity, he received a practical education in design fundamentals, from composition and technique to digital modes of production. Since then, he has gravitated toward the poster format, which he favors precisely for its limitations; he has explained that its size restrictions engender discipline and economy of design.
Pfäffli’s largest project to date is an ongoing series of posters for Südpol, a Swiss cultural center and arts space. He has also designed magazine covers, record sleeves, and posters for Herman Miller, AGI, and the Graphic Design Festival in Breda, among others. His typographical experiments have yielded one animated project for Wired Magazine, and another for the largest LED screen in the world. His work has appeared in exhibitions such as Chaumont Design Graphique (2014), 100 Years of Swiss Graphic Design (2012), 100 Best Posters 2011, and the 2011 China International Poster Biennial.

"Jianping He is a Chinese designer based in Berlin. After studying graphic design at the China Academy of Art, He earned an MFA from the Berlin University of the Arts, and a PhD in cultural history from the Free University of Berlin. He has explained that the German emphasis on “independent thinking and play” has counterbalanced the academic discipline of his Chinese education, and his designs negotiate between these different intellectual traditions. In restrained color palettes, he executes bold poster designs with exacting precision, often incorporating both Chinese characters and Roman letters.

In 2002, he founded Hesign, a Berlin studio which designs not only posters, books, and corporate identities, but also curates exhibitions and organizes cultural events. Hesign has since added branches in Shanghai and Hanzhou. Through the studio, He has designed posters for clients like AIG, the Asian Culture and Arts Development Alliance, the Guangzhou Asian Games, and the China Academy of Art. He has also created promotional materials for contemporary artists like Keith Goddard and Yang Fudong, and curated shows for Niklaus Troxler, Xu Jiang, the Warsaw International Poster Biennale, and others. His work has appeared in solo shows in Tokyo, Nanjing, Ljubljana, Hong Kong, and Essen, many of which He curated himself. His designs have received a host of awards, including first place at the 2005 Lahti International Poster Biennial, a silver medal at the 2010 New York ADC, and awards for Typographic Excellence from the Type Directors Club in 2007 and 2010.",,,7,"Chinese, born 1973",,68735173,,,,,,Jianping He,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68735173/,,,,,23424781,23424781

"While serving in the U.S. Air Force, Otto Heino became interested in pottery by watching British potter Bernard Leach throw pots. 
Vivika, née Vivien Place, received a teaching degree and then spent two year with the WPA theater project in San Francisco. Once she discovered pottery, Vivika studied at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute), and then at the University of Southern California, where she worked under Glen Lukens, the ceramist known for his revolutionary glazing techniques. Vivika exhibited her pots at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition, and then enrolled at the Swedish Applied Arts in San Francisco. In 1941, she earned an MFA from New York state College of Ceramics at Alfred University in Alfred, NY. 
In 1952, Otto and Vivka moved to California, where Vivika became head of ceramic department at the University of Southern California, replacing Glen Lukens for three years. In the same year, the couple produced pots for Twentieth Century Fox Studios for the movie, “The Egyptian” (1953). In 1955, Vivika accepted a position to reorganize the ceramics department at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles. At that time, they opened their studio and sold their work directly to the public. In 1963, Vivka was offered a teaching position at RISD and two years later, the Heinos reopened their studio in Hopkinton, NH. 
Eventually, they returned to California and moved to Ojai, the artist community built by Beatrice Wood.

"Else Friedsam Regensteiner (1906-2003) received a teaching degree in 1925 from the Deutsche Frauenschule in Munich and continued her studies at the University of Munich. Her training in Germany took place during the heyday of Bauhaus artistic influence, but at the time Regensteiner was unaware of the school and its philosophy. It was not until her emigration to the United States in 1936 that she learned about the Bauhaus in Chicago from Marli Ehrman, who would become her weaving instructor and eventually, in 1945, Regensteiner became her teaching protégé at the Institute of Design in Chicago.

 For two years Regensteiner studied theory and drafting with Ehrman and wove yardage on a fly-shuttle loom. During these years, Ehrman, aside from teaching, provided architects like Ludwig Mies van der Rohe with fabrics for the interiors of their buildings. Ehrman encouraged Regensteiner to travel to Black Mountain College where in 1942 she took courses with Anni Albers. Upon her return to Chicago, Regensteiner taught weaving at Hull House and then at the Institute of Design. In 1945 Regensteiner opened reg/wick Handwoven Originals with Julia McVicker, a workshop which remained active until 1980.  

               The textiles by Else Regensteiner from the 1940s represent the next generation of textiles influenced by the weaving workshop at the Bauhaus, as well as textiles with a very strong and informed modern heritage. Although Regensteiner did not attend the Bauhaus, she was one of their strongest proponents of the school in the United States. She disseminated Bauhaus ideals and practiced them with the same diligence, technical virtuosity, and experimentation as her Bauhaus mentors.",,,9,,,68737039,,,,,,"Else Regensteiner (American, b.

"Joris Laarman Lab explores digital design and manufacturing processes, inventing and refining experimental techniques and media. The studio was founded in Amsterdam, Netherlands, by Dutch industrial designer Joris Laarman and his partner, filmmaker Anita Star, in 2004. The Lab integrates the work of craftsmen, scientists and designers to expand the boundaries of new design technologies. Laarman Lab has devised and experimented with advancements in the field of 3D printing, fabricating some of the first chairs 3D-printed furniture in metal and polyurethane for a 2014 exhibit at Friedman Benda Gallery, Joris Laarman Lab: Bits and Crafts. Designs are produced by the lab’s MX3D robotic printer, developed in conjunction with Autodesk. Laarman Lab regularly produces videos of its printer at work and plans to share blueprints for some of its chair designs online, making the files available for home fabrication as 3D printing technologies improve and become more affordable for personal use.

"Ashbee was born in Isleworth on May 17, 1863, and died in Sevenoaks (Kent) on May 23, 1942.  He read history at King’s College, Cambridge, and studied architecture in the office of G. F. Bodley.  He was taken by the ideas of John Ruskin and William Morris, and in 1887 he set up the School of Handicraft, which lasted  until 1895, and, in 1888, the Guild of Handicraft, which was liquidated in 1907 (although it continued in much reduced form until 1919).  By 1890, there were workshops in the East End and a retail outlet in Mayfair.  In 1902, the works moved to Chipping Camden in the Cotswolds.  The Guild specialized, based on Ashbee’s designs, in metalworking, producing jewelry and cutlery and tableware, as well as hand-wrought copper and wrought iron work, along with furniture.  The London County Council created polytechnic institutes inspired by the School, and the Guild took on craftworkers at minimal charge; they out-competed the Guild, which operated as a cooperative (a romantic apolitical socialism) and at a very high standard of craftsmanship, producing costly goods, and soon drove it out of business.  Ashbee also set up the Essex House Press, where books were printed by hand, after Morris’ Kelmscott Press closed in 1897, taking on many of the unemployed printers and craftsmen.  Ashbee designed two typefaces, influenced by Morris, and wrote two utopian novels also influenced by Morris (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",,,3,"English, 1863 - 1942",,68739451,,,,,,Charles Robert Ashbee,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68739451/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"George Cartlidge was a Morris Ware designer who worked for Sampson Hancock & Sons from 1918-1926.

Born in 1868, George Cartlidge was an English painter, ceramic modeler and decorator. He apprenticed at the Sherwin & Cotton tile works where he created tiles decorated with portraits or figural subjects. As a decorator for Sampson Hancock & Sons in Stoke-on-Trent from the 1890’s to the early 20th century, he worked on plant designs for the manufactury's “Morris Ware” line. After World War I, Cartlidge traveled to America where he  continued to model portrait panels and designed tiles for a manufacturer in Newport, Kentucky. While in America, he continued to send his designs back to England for production.",,,2,,,68739447,,,,,,George Cartlidge,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68739447/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Klose was born in Berlin and studied at the Berlin Akademie
under the royal theatre painter Karl Wilhelm Gropius, later working in his workshop. He traveled in Rome and Paris, but lived and worked in Berlin throughout his life. Klose made a number of views of the Berlin palaces for the Prussian royal family and contributed a view of the sitting room in Berlin to the Wittgenstein Album (Praz, 1964: 237-38). Many of his interior drawings are in the watercolor collection of Friedrich Wilhelm IV at the Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg, and, like his contemporary Eduard Gaertner, he was considered a specialist of interior architecture painting.

"Landscape painter, watercolorist, engraver, and lithographer William Delamotte
was born in Weymouth in County Dorset to a French refugee family. He studied at the Royal Academy beginning in 1794 (Wood, Christopher. The Dictionary of Victorian Painters, 2nd ed. Woodbridge, Suffolk, England: Antique Collectors' Club, 1978: 124). In 1803, he was appointed Second Landscape Drawing Master at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (Wilson, Arnold. ""St. Nicholas Church Museum,"" in The Burlington Magazine 120, no. 899, Feb. 1978: 86-87). Delamotte was a friend of Benjamin West (1738–1820) and consulted with him extensively on the restoration of an altarpiece by William Hogarth (1697–1764) at St. Nicholas Church, Bristol. He actively exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1793 to 1851 and traveled throughout Wales, Belgium, France, northern Italy, and Switzerland. Delamotte is perhaps best known for his illustrated topographical books about Oxford and for his landscape paintings.

"Born in Berlin to a master cabinetmaker, Eduard Gaertner began his artistic career
with drawing lessons at the age of five in Cassel. He returned to Berlin after 1813
and studied painting at the Königliche Porzellanmanufaktur, where he stayed
until approximately 1821. Gaertner became an assistant in the studio of theatrical
scene painter Karl Wilhelm Gropius (1793–1870) and worked as a painter of
stage sets. He first exhibited at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Berlin. In
1824–25, he was commissioned to paint interior views of the Berlin Cathedral and
the chapel of the Schloss Charlottenburg. He spent three years in Paris, where he
studied under Jean-Victor Bertin (1767–1842), and later mounted an exhibition at
the Berlin Akademie of works he had completed there. This exhibition greatly increased his visibility, and King Wilhelm III of Prussia acquired several of his works. Under the patronage of the Prussian royal family, Gaertner launched a career as a painter of Berlin architecture and interiors, developing a specialty in topographic and panoramic views.

"Alexandre-Dominique Denuelle was a noted decorative painter and pupil of Paul
Delaroche (1797–1856) and (Jacques-) Félix Duban (1797–1870) in the 1830s, and later collaborated with Hippolyte Flandrin (1809–1864). He traveled extensively through Italy, recording the ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii and copying the
paintings of thirteenth- and fourteenth century masters such as Cimabue, Giotto,
and Zuccari. He was elected the paintermember of the French Comité des
Monuments Historiques and documented the decoration of French cathedrals and
churches, often sending these drawings to the Paris Salon. Denuelle carried out an
enormous program of decorative fresco painting in ecclesiastical, public, and private buildings all over France, with specific work known at Saint-Germain-des-Près, the Grand Gallery of the Louvre, and the Abbey of Saint-Denis in Paris.

"From Amazon site: ""Amazon Mechanical Turk is a marketplace for work that requires human intelligence. The Mechanical Turk service gives businesses access to a diverse, on-demand, scalable workforce and gives Workers a selection of thousands of tasks to complete whenever it's convenient.
Amazon Mechanical Turk is based on the idea that there are still many things that human beings can do much more effectively than computers, such as identifying objects in a photo or video, performing data de-duplication, transcribing audio recordings, or researching data details. Traditionally, tasks like this have been accomplished by hiring a large temporary workforce (which is time consuming, expensive, and difficult to scale) or have gone undone.""
The name is based on the famous 18th century chess-playing automaton made by Wolfgang von Kepelen, which was not actually an automaton but instead hid a human chess player inside a cabinet (see illustration).",,,1,launched 2005,,68790675,,,,,,Mechanical Turk,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68790675/,,,,,,

"The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is an agency of the US Department of Defense responsible for the development of new technologies for use by the military. DARPA has been responsible for funding the development of many technologies which have had a major impact on the world, including computer networking, the Internet, and NLS, which was both the first hypertext system, and an important precursor to the contemporary ubiquitous graphical user interface.
 
DARPA began as the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) created in 1958 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower for the purpose of forming and executing research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science and go beyond immediate military needs. The administration was responding to the Soviet launching of Sputnik, the first artificial Earth satellite, in 1957. ARPA's mission was to ensure that US military technology be more sophisticated than that of the nation's potential enemies.

ARPA was renamed to ""DARPA"" (for Defense) in March 1972, then renamed ""ARPA"" in February 1993, and then renamed ""DARPA"" again in March 1996. DARPA is independent from other more conventional military research and development and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management. DARPA focuses on short-term (two to four year) projects run by small, purpose-built teams.",,,4,USA,,68248131,,,,,,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68248131/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Born in Valencia, Spain in 1951, Santiago Calatrava is an internationally-acclaimed Spanish architect and designer known for his civic commissions and community landmark designs. He is among the few architects also trained as an engineer and holds dual Ph.D. degrees in structural engineering and technical science. In 1981, Calatrava opened his architecture firm in Zurich, Switzerland. He first gained recognition for his bold bridge designs, including the Pont de’ l’Europe (Bridge of Europe) over the Loire River in Orléans, France, and the Alamillo Bridge in Seville, Spain. These innovative projects exemplify Calatrava’s expertise in uniting the aesthetic concerns of architecture with the technical aspects of engineering. He takes inspiration from painting and sculpture, as well as the work of two architects: Antonio Gaudi (Catalonian-Spanish, 1852-1926) and Eero Saarinen (Finnish-American, 1910-1961). Calatrava’s design language synthesizes Saarinen’s playful geometrical lines with Gaudi’s ambitious shapes to create distinct, daring and sometimes controversial projects.

Drawings and models by Calatrava are held in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In March 2006, the Metropolitan Museum of Art mounted a special exhibition of Calatrava’s drawings, sculpture, and architectural models. Santiago Calatrava is also the recipient of numerous honorary degrees and awards. The Council for the Arts of MIT awarded the architect the Eugene McDermott Award in 2005, one of the most prestigious design awards in the US.",,,1,"Spanish, born 1951",,68248397,,,,,,Santiago Calatrava,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68248397/,,,,,23424950,23424950

"Dutch designers Stefan Scholten (b. 1972) and Carole Baijings (b. 1973) have worked together in a creative partnership as Scholten & Baijings since 2000.  Scholten is a graduate of the Design Academy Eindhoven, and Baijings is self-educated.  

Their partnership started when Scholten was asked to design a small bar for the agency where Baijings worked.  Both designers have described their collaborative work as a natural progression, with Scholten always keeping the bigger picture in mind, and Baijings always considering the details.

The Scholten and Baijings portfolio consists of highly crafted, covetable objects, such as soft, striped merino pillows and throws, charming glass and ceramic vessels, and silk scarves.  Their work is mostly known for their minimalist aesthetic, and rich explorations in graphics, color, and, as some would say, a sense of humor. They celebrate graphic lines, allowing movement and light to enhance their objects that were created with sharp technical production.  Recent collaborations have included work for Georg Jensen, Maharam, 1616/Arita Japan, and Pastoe, a Dutch furniture brand.",,,18,"Dutch, founded 2000",,68248227,,,,,,Scholten & Baijings,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68248227/,,,,,23424909,23424909

"Charles Horner (English, 1821–1896), trained as a “watchmaker, jeweler, and silversmith” and was listed thus in early directories of Halifax, in Yorkshire, England, as well as in its 1871 census. After his training, he set up a firm to retail and manufacture jewelry, watches and small silver articles in Halifax in about 1867.

Horner developed a line of good-quality jewelry aimed at the middle market, to be produced with some handcrafting, but increasingly through mass-production techniques. His best-known product outside of jewelry was the Dorcas thimble, a revolutionary idea that resulted in a more functional yet still decorative personal item. His invention was to make a thimble with three layers of metal, the inner and outer layers silver, the middle one steel.  The result was a beautiful exterior, a smooth safe interior and a strong core. Granted a patent no 8954 in March 1885, the thimble was produced with a variety of designs on the exterior, and became a major money maker as women who sewed could all appreciate this as a pretty piece of silver, as well as a functional thimble that kept the needle from pushing into their fingers.[1]
 
After its start as a retailer in Halifax the firm was primarily a manufacturer and wholesaler predominantly through catalogues. The retail side of Charles Horner lasted from about 1867 to 1905. With the creation of a purpose-built manufactory in Mile Cross, Halifax, in 1905, Charles Horner Ltd. dropped the retail side of the business and devoted itself to manufacturing and wholesale until 1984. The major center of jewelry industry and trade was Birmingham. Although the firm remained headquartered in Halifax, they opened a Birmingham retail and wholesale showroom in 1895. The retail shop there, like that in Halifax, was closed in 1905, but Birmingham continued on with wholesale wares only until about 1940. As Birmingham was the center of the jewelry industry and trade, this enabled the Horners to display their goods to buyers coming to see jewelry products there. Charles’s two sons, James Dobson Horner, the businessman, and Charles Henry (Harry) Horner, the artistic one, ran the Birmingham operation until their father’s death in 1896, after which the two sons remained in charge of the whole firm, still based in Halifax, until James’s untimely death in 1913.

The firm moved to its purpose-built factory at a time when Art Nouveau jewelry at the height of fashion. It is from the period 1905 to 1913, after this factory was opened and before James’s death, that the brooches and pendants in this collection exist. This was firm’s strongest period; after James’s death followed rapidly by World War I, and a general strike of 1920, the art nouveau style with which the firm was so associated, was no longer in fashion. Although new enterprises, such as molded Dorcasine plastic jewelry and giftware revived the firm later, the art nouveau period, along with the Thimble production, were the firm's primary areas of production.

"""Louis Dalbet was running a family ironwork business. Jean and André, his two sons, worked alongside four other employees. Louis Dalbet trained at the Robert workshop. Around 1912, he had worked as a journeyman around France and then set up on his own. He opened a workshop at 4 bis, Rue Capron specializing in decorative wrought-iron work. Concentrating on railings, banisters, and fireguards, he also did all the ironwork for the well-known Brasserie Bofinger. From time to time, he would design items and exhibit at the Salon d'Automne. In 1917, he was awarded the Prix de Rome for a gate he designed. A year after his meeting with Pierre Chareau in 1923, their collaboration was well under way. He was Chareau's own choice and was the only ironworker to work with him from then on.""

"Suzanne Lalique-Haviland has created many designs for ceramics and porcelains, textiles, decorative objects and glassware. She was also a painter and, in the second part of her life, set and costume designer for theatre.
The granddaughter of the ornemantalist sculptor Auguste Ledru (1837-1918) and daughter of  the well-known designer of jewels and glassware René Lalique (1860–1945), Suzanne has begun to design decorative objects from 1910 (she probably started with a powder box for the René Coty perfumes). She created decorations for the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres and provided a lot of models for printed textiles or fabrics, which were regularly exhibited and edited by Maison Lauer or Tassinari and Chatel.
She created many gouache-painted decorative screens, highly appreciated by Jacques Doucet (1853-1929), who owned several of them.
She also collaborated regularly with her father René, particularly for the interior decoration of the Paris ocean liner in 1919 (she notably designed the textiles and the curtains for the Salon de conversation). Very aware of the artistic skills of his daughter, René Lalique encouraged Suzanne in participating in the family enterprise. From 1920 to 1930, a large part of the Lalique glass production is inspired by her watercolors, in which she reveals her passion for nature and the vegetal world. She became quickly the art deco muse of the family enterprise, making it enter fully in this productive golden era, by her great sense of stylization, her artistic skill for developing geometric shapes and mixing all sources of inspiration.
Married in 1917 with Paul Burty-Haviland, a photographer from the famous porcelain family, she became artistic collaborator of the Haviland manufacture in Limoges from 1924. She designs models until 1935.
In the 1930’s she turns herself to the painting, producing mostly still lifes, compositions occasionally reproduced from her husband’s photographs.  From 1937 to the beginning of the 1970’s, she created numerous sets and costumes for the theatre, especially for the Comédie Française. She also was a regular collaborator of Jean Meyer for the Théâtre des Célestins, in Lyon, until 1985.",,,3,"French, 1892 - 1989",,69123499,,,,,,Suzanne Lalique,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/69123499/,,,,,23424819,23424819

"The Guerrilla Girls are a group of anonymous female artists—known for wearing gorilla masks—formed in 1985 in New York City. The group’s goal was to use art and performance as a tool to protest sexual and racial inequalities. They were formed as a reaction to MoMA’s 1985 exhibition, “An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture,” featuring 169 artists, only thirteen of which were women. The Guerrilla Girls responded by staging a protest outside the museum. When little attention followed, they produced a poster campaign in SoHo and the East Village.",,,3,"USA, established 1985",,18043169,,,,,,Guerrilla Girls,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043169/,,,,,23424977,23424977

She is known for her quiet, uncluttered and ecclectic style of design which undoubtedly began to take shape during her time at The Cooper Union School of Art, in New York, where she recieved a Bachelor's of Fine Art. Soon after her graduation, from the mid-seventies to the early eighties she worked as a staff designer for CBS Television Network, CBS Records and Atlantic Records under art director Paula Scher.

After her extensive experience in design and advertising for major music and television corporations, in 1982 she established Carin Goldberg Design in New York where she is currently the principal. Her roster of clients include publishing houses such as Simon nd Schuster, Random House, Harper Collins, Hyperion, Doubleday, Time Inc., and Nonesuch Records, a music company.

Carin Goldberg's work has been showcased in numerous exhibitions including and design annuals including the Walker Art Museum's ""Graphic Design in America"", the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum's ""Mixing Messages"", and in Hong Kong's Heritage Museum in the ""Women Festival"" series. Her work has also been featured in magazines like Graphis, Time Magazine, Ad Week, Communication Arts, Print Casebooks, Metropolis, and Print.

"Chip Kidd, the new York based graphic designer and writer, has become one of, if not the most famous book jacket designer to date. Born in 1964 and raised in Reading, Pennsylvania; his designs have been, according to Graphic Design: America Two, credited with ""helping to spawn a revolution in the art of American book packaging in the last ten years."" One of the most consistent characteristics of Kidd's revolutionary style is the fact that his book jackets do not have a signature look. According to Kidd, ""A signature look is crippling...[because] the simplest  and most effective solutions aren't dictated by style.""
     
     Kidd graduated from Pennsylvania State University where he majored in graphic design and became interested in the work of Paul Saville, the designer of British record sleeves for whose designs he still considers a major influence on his work.
    
      Most of Kidd's more famous book jackets have been created during his ongoing fifteen years plus run at the venerable Alfred A. Knopf publishing house under art director, Carol Devine Carson, who according to The New York Times ""is credited with helping overhaul old ways of using type, artwork, photography and color on book jackets."" Kidd's list of clients is made up of some of the most well known and celebrated authors of today including Anne Rice, John Updike, Dean Koontz and Michael Crichton for whom he created the now iconic illustration of a dinosaur skeleton for his book ""Jurassic Park"". Kidd's dinosaur skeleton also became the central image of the movie marketing campaign as well. He also designed the catalogue cover for the Cooper-Hewitt's ""Mixing Messages"" exhibitions. 
    
      Kidd's work has been featured in Vanity Fair, Time, The New York Times, Graphis, New York and ID magazines. Chip Kidd has also written about graphic design for Vogue, The New York Times, the New York Observer, Arena, Details, The New York Post and Print magazines. He also wrote and designed the cover for his novel ""Cheese Monkeys"".",,,15,born 1964,,18043673,,,,,,Chip Kidd,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043673/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Born outside Vienna, Herbert Bayer studied at the Weimar Bauhaus from 1921 to 1923 under Johannes Itten and Wassily Kandinsky. When the school moved to Dessau in 1925, Bayer was hired by Walter Gropius to head his newly created typography and graphic design workshop. Bayer’s most dramatic innovation was his creation of a universal typeface that organized the alphabet around simple, geometrically constructed forms. Because spoken language does not differentiate between capital and lowercase letters, Bayer created an efficient font organized around four arcs, three angles, vertical and horizontal lines, and all lowercase sans serif letters. This change was particularly drastic in Germany where Blackletter script prevailed. The Bauhaus adopted a variation of Bayer’s universal typeface for all of its printed materials. In addition, Bayer developed a communications hierarchy in which the type size and weight progressed from the most important to the least important information. Bars, rules, rectangles, and boxes were used to subdivide the surface and stress the most important words. All these elements, combined with pictorial images, were organized in a dynamic diagonal composition using flush left and ragged right typesetting. One bright color with black was the favored color scheme.

In 1928, Bayer left the Bauhaus to set up a graphic design studio in Berlin. He worked for the Dorland advertising agency and served as art director for Paris Vogue from 1929 to 1930. By the mid-1930s, several Bauhaus colleagues, including László Moholy-Nagy and Gropius had immigrated to the United States. Bayer was looking for work in America and Gropius gave him the role of organizing the 1938 exhibition, Bauhaus 1919–1928, for MoMA. This project provided Bayer with the perfect opportunity to introduce European modernist design ideas to the American public. He chose the objects, wrote the catalog, and organized the exhibition. 

Bayer was able to further develop his commitment to educating the public and industry on the role of graphic design in improving human life after he moved to America in 1938. His great opportunity came when he was hired as a designer for the Container Corporation of America, for which he created a series of illustrated posters during World War II. Bayer’s design ideas perfectly matched the interests of the company’s owner, Walter P. Paepcke, who became a close friend. Paepcke wanted to build a nature and cultural resort in Aspen, Colorado, where they could hold conferences and cultural festivals to educate industrial and cultural leaders in social and environmental responsibility. Under Paepcke’s patronage, Bayer relocated to Aspen and from there designed posters, brochures, letterhead, architecture, and books for the Aspen Institute of Humanistic Studies. Bayer’s position at the Aspen Institute brought him to the attention of other corporate clients, including Olivetti Typewriter, for whom he designed two posters for the Olivetti adding machine. In 1966, after Paepcke’s death, Bayer became the graphic design consultant for the Atlantic Richfield Corporation.",,,2,"Austrian, active Germany and USA, 1900–1985",,18059359,,,,,,Herbert Bayer,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18059359/,,,,,23424750,23424750

"The Romanian-born Steinberg studied architecture in Milan beginning in 1933, but soon after began publishing cartoons, and by the time he graduated in 1940, his drawings were appearing in Life and Harper’s Bazaar. In 1941, anti-Jewish laws in Fascist Italy forced him to immigrate to the United States. He began publishing regularly in The New Yorker, a relationship that lasted almost sixty years and produced ninety covers and over a thousand drawings and cartoons. Steinberg was an Artist in Residence at the Smithsonian in 1967, and is well represented in the Smithsonian collections, with at least forty works in the Smithsonian American Art Museum.",,,26,"American, b.

"Hiroshige (1797-1858) Japanese painter and printmaker, known for his landscape prints. Last great figure of the Ukiyo-e school of printmaking. Inspired by the prints of Hokusai, he studied and was apprennticed to, Utagawa Toyohiro. From 1811 to 1830 he created prints of traditional subjects, young women and actors. 1830 to 1845 he concentrated on landscape prints, reaching fame in 1833 with the print series Fifty-three Stations of the Tokaido. Other travel series, Celebrated Places in Japan, and Sixty-nine Stations on the Kiso Highway, also display the high level of craftsmanship for which he is known. In the later period of his life, the increasing popularity of his images resulted in a falling off of the technical brillance of the earlier work.

"April Greiman trained at Kansas City Art Institute (1966-70). She continued her post-graduate studies with Wolfgang Weingart and Armin Hoffman at the Kunstgewerberschule, Basel (1970-71). Greiman was an instructor at Philadelphia College of Art and was working in both Philadelphia and New York.
In 1976, she moved to Los Angeles and established a studio, where she became the leading figure of emergent ""NEW WAVE"" design.  Greiman was then appointed to Director of the California Institute of the Arts in 1982 where she had the opportunity to work with photographer Jayme Odgers to experiment with video and computers.

"Verner Panton was born in Denmark in 1926, he studied at the Technical College from 1944-47, and then studied architecture at the Royal Academy of Art in Copenhagen from 1947-1951. Panton lived and worked most of his life in Basel, Switzerland, where by the mid-1950s he was an internationally acclaimed interior architect and designer. His most decisive influence was the Danish designer Poul Henningsen who was known for his lighting design and key figure in 20th century Danish design, and who became Panton’s mentor. He also admired the work of Arne Jacobsen, and worked in his office form 1950-52. At this time Jacobsen was one of Denmark’s leading architects, and though he built relatively few buildings, Panton referred to himself as both an architect and designer. 

Panton loved to experiment with his work. Some of his greatest designs came from toying with different materials, production techniques, traditional design, as well as manipulating light and color. Color is one of Panton’s trademarks, as well as the central element of his design. He studied the physics of light and published a booklet, Notes of Colour, in 1997. He was constantly searching for innovations in all areas of design. He started to create rooms as environments in 1960 beginning with a hotel and restaurant in Trondheim, Norway. He reached his pinnacle in 1970 with the legendary Visiona 2 exhibition in Cologne, which was commissioned by the Bayer chemical company. Panton’s comprehensive approach to design as well as the design of radical environments was then emulated by designers like Pierre Paulin and Joe Colombo. 

As mentioned, color  was a central element in all of Verner Panton’s designs for interiors and furniture, and in particular, textiles, which became his most important vehicle for color in the futurist environments for which Panton is best known. When Panton left Jacobsen’s office in 1952, he traveled throughout Europe introducing designs for chairs, lighting, and textiles to a number of companies and obtaining commissions mainly for Danish projects. In 1968 Panton was commissioned by the paint and fiber manufacturer, Bayer, to design an environment at the Cologne Furniture Fair using synthetic fibers and materials.  Intended as an annual series of exhibitions to take place on a boat, Panton advised Bayer to call it Visiona. For Visiona 0 in 1968, the futurist environment was referred to as the Dralon Boat, and included furniture, lighting, and textiles, a combination which caused a visually interesting and an almost dizzying effect. 

The Anatomical Designs, which included Lippen, were initially part of Visiona 0 from 1968. Round rooms of various colors were bedecked with draperies and round floor carpets on which were printed large photorealist representations of hands, feet, mouths, eyes and ears. The model for these body parts was his wife, Marianne. Later, the Swiss textile company, Mira-X, produced these designs under the name of Anatomic. The Visiona series continued until the mid-1970s under Panton’s leadership and featured such illustrious designers as Joe Colombo.  However, it soon featured only home textiles rather than presenting Panton’s idea of a model living environment, where every new technical innovation in the field of synthetic materials was put to use.  


Panton began a long-term collaboration with the Swiss textile manufacturer, Mira-X, in 1969.  Panton’s collections for Mira-X were based on his idea of an integral concept of living, and a vision of colored space. Many of these textiles also represented Panton’s love for experimentation with form, material, and production techniques.  Every fabric was a variation on the initial collection, which was based on a limited number of geometric patterns and only eight pure colors with additional tonal variations. The number of colors and patterns grew over time, but by the 1980s Mira-X ceased to manufacture Panton textiles, and the interest in his work waned. 

In addition to textiles, the Cooper-Hewitt currently has the stacking side chair (1977-1-1) and Cone chair (1986-99-44) by Panton. Lippen represents some of his strongest work designed at the pinnacle of his career, and since it is an earlier textile design, is more in keeping with the 1959-60 design of the chairs. The Cooper-Hewitt also has in its collection seven textiles from 1983 produced by Mira-X, which one of his more innovative and unusual fabrics produced during the early 1970s, Finesse: Circle (2011-36-2), a printed textile with areas of burn out within the circles. This created a semi-translucent textile that when held up to the light would have created a very dappled light and feeling of three-dimensionality. Finesse designs also included Square and Curve.",,,11,"Danish, 1926–1998",,18045471,,,,,,Verner Panton,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045471/,,,,,23424796,23424796

Then she works fits the metal to the glass fusing them together. Her glass seems to ooze out of the metal, giving it a unique movement.

"Guimard was born in Lyon on March 10, 1867, and died in New York on May 20, 1942.  He attended the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs and then the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1882-5.  It appears that he was strongly influenced by Victor Horta’s Hôtel Tassel in Brussels.  Guimard’s Castel Béranger of 1898 made him famous and he received many commissions, including the entries into the stations of the Paris Metro.  His approach was one of design totality, and his buildings’ interior spaces, decorations and furnishings corresponded to the exterior appearance and structure.  The Castel Béranger and his 1909 Hotel Guimard exemplify this total design approach.  He devoted great attention to the public spaces (stairs, doorways, etc.) as well as the private spaces (floor and wall coverings, ceiling ornaments, lighting fixtures, door and window hardware, fireplaces, and furniture).  He particularly appreciated the inherent characteristics of cast iron and did not attempt to reproduce the architectonic forms of wrought iron or stone; at the same time, he made full use of cast iron’s moldable nature, using it to model the curves and reliefs of vegetation relating to the overall design of the particular project.  In 1907, he published a catalog of cast iron elements, Fontes Artistiques pour Constructions, Fumisterie, Articles de Jardins, et Sepultres (ornamental cast iron for buildings, fireplace fittings, garden fixtures, tombs), to which title he appended Style Guimard, in a cartouche; the catalog contained over two hundred models.  His difficult personality hindered his career, which slowed considerably after World War I.  Fearing the coming war and concerned about anti-Semitism (his wife was Jewish), he moved to New York in 1938, where he died in 1942 (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",,,234,"French, 1867–1942, active Paris, France, 1885–1929",,18042569,,,,,,Hector Guimard,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042569/,,,,,23424819,23424819

"Keith Haring was born in Reading, PA, 4 May 1958 and raised in the nearby town of Kutztown.  Prior to moving to New York City in 1978, Haring studied art at the Ivy School and The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts.  From 1978 to 1980 Haring attended the School of Visual Arts in New York.   Inspired by the graphic strength of graffiti, Haring's ""comic book"" style of drawing developed early in the 1980s when he created iconographic characters which he drew on the subway walls.  Concerned with topics as diverse as AIDS, nuclear holocaust and ecology, Haring employed images of crawling babies, rainbows and barking dogs that serve as emblems of the human condition.  A performance artist, poet and videoartist, Haring made a considerable impact on the East Village art scene in the early 1980s.  He exhibited drawings and paintings in the United States and Europe throughout the 1980s and accepted mural commissions in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; and New York. He died of AIDS 16 February 1990.",,,7,"American, 1958 – 1990",,18053541,,,,,,Keith Allen Haring,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053541/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Alfons Bach was born in Germany in 1904. He studied film directing and design in Europe before coming to the United States in 1926.
Bach settled in the New York metropolitan area. His projects included the remodeling of Sach's furniture store, which occupied the first several floors of the Manhattan's Hoover Building. Bach was responsible for remodeling both the exterior of the building and the interiors of the store. Another major commission was the redesign of the Seneca Textile Building on 34th Street; Bach won an award from the Fifth Avenue Association for his work on this project.
Bach designed and built his own home in Stamford, CT in 1938. Beginning in the late 1940s, he spearheaded a plan for what became on of the first shopping malls in America; the Ridgeway Center of Stamford. Bach designed the entire shopping mall, including many of the individual stores' interiors. The editors of Exhibitor and Theatre Catalog selected Bach's Ridgeway Theatre for their merit award.
After moving to Florida in 1959, Bach continued his design practice. A major project was the Palm Trial Plaza, a marina apartment complex in Delray Beach. Bach was selected to direct the United States exhibits at the 1962 International Industrial Design Exhibition in Paris.
Bach was a noted watercolor painter as well a designer. His paintings were featured in numerous exhibitions in the United States and America.",,,606,"German, 1904–1999",,18053553,,,,,,Alfons Bach,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053553/,,,,,23424829,23424829

"Metalworker, furniture and industrial designer. Born New York City, September 26, 1909. Wallance             graduated New York University in 1930 with a B.A. in English Literature. He traveled to northern Europe            where he was exposed to the International Style in architecture and design. Upon returning to the United            States, he went to work in his father's furniture store and saw the need for more inventive designs in retail furnishings. He attended Design Laboratory School in New York City from its inception in 1936 until it closed its doors in 1940. From 1941-2, Wallance served as the state of Louisiana's technical and design director for the National Youth Administration, established in 1940 by President Roosevelt to help build a young, technically capable work force. During World War II, Wallance designed mass-produced furniture for servicemen's families living abroad for the Office of the Quartermaster General, Washington. He began designing tableware, cutlery, and accessories for H.E. Lauffer in 1951. 
 Among his most recognizable designs for Lauffer were Design One, a highly sculptural, brushed stainless steel flatware created in 1953, and Design Ten, a colored plastic flatware created in 1978-79. Both designs are now produced by Towle Manufacturing Company. In addition, Wallance designed auditorium seating in steel and upholstered polyurethane foam for Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center in 1964 and hospital furniture in steel and plastics for Hard Manufacturing Company in 1965. Wallance is best known for his book, ""Shaping America's Products"", 1956, which remains a seminal study of the relationship of craftsmanship to industry.",,,1078,"American, 1909 – 1990",,18053597,,,,,,Donald A.

"Jules-Frédéric Bouchet was an architect and engraver who began his career as a
student of French architect and designer Charles Percier (1764–1838). In 1822,
Bouchet obtained second prize in the Grand Prix of architecture for his design
of an opera-house interior. While he lived and worked in Paris, Bouchet was
enamored with Italian ruins and antiquities. After a trip to study them from 1825
to 1828, he completed twenty-seven engraved illustrations of the Maison du
poète tragique `a Pomp’ei (The House of the Tragic Poet at Pompeii), one of the first major studies of a Pompeiian house. Upon his return to Paris, he was named  Inspector of the Works of the Royal Library (later the Bibliothèque Nationale) under
Ludovico-Tullio-Giacomo Visconti (1791–1853). Bouchet was also named Inspector of the Tomb of Napoleon, and finally was appointed chief architect of the tomb project after Visconti’s death.

"Rudolf von Alt was from a family of talented and prolific Viennese artists who
excelled at architecture and landscape subjects. He studied first with his father,
Jakob Alt, and received formal training from 1825 to 1832 at the Akademie der
Bildenden Künste, Vienna, where he was later a member. In 1832, his work earned
him a prize, which freed him from military service and allowed him to devote himself fully to art. 

Like his brother, Alt traveled extensively, visiting areas of Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and, beginning as early as 1834, exhibited works he had made during these trips in Berlin, Munich, Vienna, Dresden, and Paris. He was commissioned by Czar Alexander II in 1863 to execute views of the imperial residences in the Crimea. The Lanckoronski watercolors are two of a series of ten completed for a commission by Count Karol Lanckoronski (1848–1933) of his residence prior to the construction of the Palais Lanckoronski in 1894–95. A well-known and soughtafter artist, Alt was ennobled in 1882, and in 1897 was nominated honorary president of the Vienna Secession by Gustav Klimt.

"Charles James Richardson trained as an architect with Sir John Soane (1753–1837)
and was later the curator of the Sir John Soane Museum. He was a talented architectural draftsman who owned a large and valuable collection of architects’
drawings and designs. His Observations on the Architecture of England (1837), a volume extensively illustrated with details of plasterwork, moldings, and woodcarving, was of great value to fellow architects. In the 1840s, Richardson drew and painted the treasures at Goodrich Court for the noted collector Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, thus feeding his antiquarian inclinations. The studies include specimens of unusual early furniture and objects as well as rooms from ancient houses. He exhibited seventeen works at the Royal Academy, including views of the Chapel Royal, St. James’s, Holland House, and Sutton Place.

"Relatively little is known about C. M. Fredro, a member of a prominent Polish
noble family forced into exile during the political upheavals of the nineteenth century. A friend of Charles de Talleyrand, Fredro would have been about sixteen
years old in 1836 when A Room in the Reuss Palace, Dresden was completed. Another drawing in the Thaw Collection, A Room in a Florentine Palace, came from an album which may have been assembled by Fredro’s sister and originally contained a number of his drawings. He seemed to have a talent for caricature; comical drawings record a visit that he made in 1848 with Talleyrand to Rochecotte, the French château belonging to the Marquise de Castellane.

He also traveled to Rome, Naples, and Sicily, and returned to Italy regularly to continue sketching, producing a series of views in the late 1850s.

"William Henry Hunt began studying with John Varley (1778–1842), draftsman and
founding member in 1804 of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. Evidence of
this tutelage is apparent in Hunt’s early landscapes, genre scenes, and architectural studies. In 1806, Hunt showed at the Royal Academy and enrolled for formal study the following year. Early in his career, he found employment by painting views of gentleman’s country seats, of which the Cassiobury drawing is one example. Hunt worked primarily in watercolor and first exhibited at the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1814, joining as a full member in 1826. He is best known for his still lifes, for which the English art critic and theorist John Ruskin called him “the good peach and apple painter” in 1879 (Treble, Rosemary. ""Hastings.

"Venini Glassworks, originally founded as Cappellin Venini & C. by Paolo Venini and Giacomo Cappellin in 1921, is arguably one of the best-known manufacturers of fine Italian art glass and lighting. The company hired Italian painter Vittorio Zecchin as its first art director. Throughout its history, Venini used major national and international expositions to introduce its wares to a worldwide audience and create an export market  for premium examples. 

In 1925, the founders parted ways and VSM Venini & C. and MVM Cappellin & C. were established separately; Venini was led by its new artistic director and sculptor Napoleone Martinuzzi. By the early 1930s,  Paolo Venini—who had studied the techniques of artistic directors and artisans from early on—took an increasingly visible role in the company’s artistic direction. Carlo Scarpa arrived in 1932, and took the position of artistic director until 1946, designing lamps, domestic designs and objets d’art.

Early Venini glass reflects the streamlined Art Deco style the company helped to popularize. Venini was also known as a place where artists could collaborate with Venetian glass artisans,  to pursue their own visions in glass with the help of Venini.  The company  worked with many major designers including Gio Ponti, Carlo Scarpa, Ettore Sottsass, Fulvio Bianconi, and others. 
Venini was a pioneer who introduced what today is known as mid-century modern design, especially with lighting using glass in colors of 1950s modernism. Venini designs have simple shapes and striking colors.

"Architect, Keith Murray (English, born in New Zealand, 1892-1981) was a notable and influential Modernist designer in the fields of glass, ceramics and metalware from 1920 through the start of World War II. He was one of the first designers to be honored for his contributions to industry, awarded the title of Royal Designer for Industry by the Royal Society of Arts, in 1936.

Murray trained and worked as an architect until the early 1930s, when he was forced to seek work outside his field due to the Great Depression. Inspired by the 1925 Exposition in Paris and the 1931 Exhibition of Swedish Industrial Art in London, with its emphasis on co-operation between manufacturers and artists, he produced some glass designs.  He was subsequently hired by the glass firm of Stevens and Williams as a freelance designer, from 1932-1939. His designs ranged from vases to decanters to bathroom sets. Although Murray preferred pure form with minimal to no decoration, he recognized the need to design for a range of consumer tastes and created a wide variety of both traditional and  modern forms. 

In 1932 the ceramics manufacturer Wedgwood engaged Murray part-time to design a range of modern shapes. The simple forms designed by Murray were either plain or had broad geometric fluting or bands. The purity of form was underscored by the use of matte glazes in white, green, turquoise, straw and gray. Murray designed a variety of objects, including vases, book ends, inkwells, beer jugs, and mugs.

Murray also created metalwork for the firm Mappin and Webb. His designs in silver and silver plate were modern and mostly geometric in form. Decoration was limited to turned rings which both enhanced the shapes and made the pieces easy to clean.

In 1936 Murray was commissioned to design Wedgwood's new factory at Barlaston. Following the war he left the field of industrial design and returned to architecture full time.  His design work is in the permanent collections of  the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Wedgwood Museum, and the Corning Glass Museum, among others, and has been included in exhibitions on ceramics and 20th-century design.

"Lockwood de Forest (1850-1932) was the protégé of the celebrated nineteenth-century landscape painter Frederic E. Church.  Church trained de Forest in landscape painting during the early 1870s and engendered in his pupil a passion for exotic places and exotic decorative arts objects.  This interest led de Forest first to the Holy Land and Egypt and finally to India, in 1881, where he went on his honeymoon for over a year to study and look for objects to import to the United States. An introduction to Muggunbhai Hutheesing, a Jain merchant whose family had recently commissioned an elaborate carved temple in Ahmedabad, in Gujarat, India, and still employed many of the most skilled craftsmen, led to the de Forest studio being set up in  Ahmedabad. Its purpose was to produce  hand-carved, by Mistri craftsmen, Indian teak panels and furniture, along with decorative brasswork which de Forest imported to the United States for use in interior decorating projects. Using these imported materials and other objects that he collected on his travels, de Forest provided decorative arts objects for interiors either in collaboration with or for Louis Comfort Tiffany with whom he had a brief partnership (1880-82). Working independently, de Forest designed interiors for his siblings Robert and Henry de Forest, Frederic E. Church, Mary Garrett in Baltimore and with M.  Cary Thomas at Bryn Mawr College; George Wroth Knapp (Baltimore); and William Henry Appleton (Wave Hill), among others.",,,15,"American, 1850–1932",,18065337,,,,,,Lockwood de Forest,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18065337/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"William Arthur Smith Benson was a leader of the British Arts and Crafts movement. Although he trained as an architect, Benson took up metalwork at the suggestion of Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. Benson’s light fittings became models for other Arts and Crafts metalwork¬—innovative lighting designs for both candles and electric light. 

Early in his career, Benson focused predominantly on handcrafted objects and candle lighting. In 1881, he hired the brass and copper worker, John Lovegrove, who contributed great experience and skill and with whom Benson collaborated for many years. Benson’s workshop succeeded in mixing hand and machine production by maintaining an honesty of construction and a high quality of workmanship and design. 

Benson was also an active advocate for his field. He became a founding member the Art Workers’ Guild in 1884, which brought together progressive architects, designers, and craftsmen, and also helped to establish the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1887 to address the lack of exhibitions for decorative art in Britain.",,,4,1854–1924,,18043725,,,,,,William Arthur Smith Benson,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043725/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"William Grueby founded this pottery in 1894.  It produced highly acclaimed art pottery, including the famous matte green glazed vases, winning two gold medals, for enamels and glazes and for his personal accomplishment in creating the dull-finished enamels, and a silver medal for pottery design at the 1900 Paris Exposition, and a grand prize at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.  Its style and glazing were copied by others, and ultimately it went through a bankruptcy.  The financial problems resulted in the incorporation of the Grueby Pottery Co. and later the Grueby Faience and Tile Company.  Over time, the firm shifted its focus to architectural faience.  The tiles continued to be produced from 1919 until at least 1928 by the Pardee Tile Works in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, which bought Grueby’s company (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",,,14,1895–1908,,18043793,,,,,,"Grueby Faience Company, Revere, Massachusetts",,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043793/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Edward F. Caldwell and Victor F. von Lossberg founded Edward F. Calwell & Company in 1894 in New York City. They became the most prominent manufacturers of custom lighting fixtures and metalwork in the late 19th to early 20th centuries.
Their success was due to their ability to incorporate popular and eclectic styles from French Neoclassical to Art Deco into their designs for electric lighting fixtures. Since they worked with the leading architects of the day, Caldwell lighting fixtures and decorative metalwork appeared in many major building projects, including the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, St. Patrick`s Cathedral, Andrew Carnegie`s mansion (now home to Cooper-Hewitt), and the 1902 renovation of the White House. For these projects, architectural plans would be brought in and drawings and occasionally models would be created. By the 1920s, Caldwell & Company had one of the largest foundries in New York City. They were one of the few American firms that mastered the techniques for applying enamel decorations to metalwork and were renowed for their casting and gilding of bronze. They produced fine metalwork objects such as tables, lamps, clocks, desk sets , fire screens and statues. All items were custom made with few exceptions. Due to the Depression, the firm was forced to scale down their operation. The company was liquidated by the Internal Revenue Service in 1956, but reorganized and reemerged that same year as E.T. Caldwell Lighting Company. The Company eventually went out of business entirely in 1959.",,,3,"New York, New York, USA, 1894–1959",,18050417,,,,,,Edward F.

"Established in 1937 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by scientist Edwin Land, the Polaroid Corporation started as a research and marketing firm for a glare reducing plastic Land developed between 1929 and 1934. Land guided the company to become a leader in polarizing technology, which it applied to a variety of products from glare-reducing goggles to night vision devices and cameras for the military and the private sector. Polaroid became best known for the invention of Land cameras that developed their own film in minutes, the first introduced in 1948 and designed by industrial designer Walter Dorwin Teague. Land realized the value of industrial design about a decade earlier when he first engaged Teague and his consultancy to design the Polaroid Exective desk lamp marketed in 1939. Teague designed a number of cameras for Polaroid before the company hired designer Henry Dreyfuss to create some of its later landmark cameras for the consumer market, such as the SX-70 and the Swinger, in the 1960s and 70s. Polaroid continues today, producing digital imaging and printing devices.",,,12,"Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA",,18050419,,,,,,Polaroid Corporation,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050419/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Gallé was born in Nancy on May 8, 1846, and died there on September 23, 1904.  Son of a faience and furniture manufacturer, he studied philosophy, botany and drawing (owing to his botanical knowledge, his floral decoration, in both glass and wood, is exceptionally accurate), and also worked in his father’s studios.  In 1866-7, he served an apprenticeship in glassmaking at Burgun, Schverer & Cie. in Meisenthal. He established his own glass studio in 1873, and, in the following year, took over his father’s glass and ceramics factory in Nancy.  His early work often used colorless glass decorated with enamel, but he soon turned to using heavy opaque glass carved or etched with floral/plant motifs, often in multiple colors.  He also experimented with inclusion of metallic foils and air bubbles.  He had highly successful showings at the Paris Exhibitions of 1878 and 1889, and at the 1891 showing at the Société national des beaux-arts, and, in particular, he showed over three hundred pieces at the 1884 Union Centrale des Arts Décoratifs exhibition, displaying his mastery of techniques, his knowledge of nature and his artistic imagination.  He established a glass workshop, the Cristallerie d’Émile Gallé, to produce in volume his designs and those of others; at its height, it employed 300 workers, and it remained in operation until 1936.  He employed master craftsmen who applied his signature only after he had approved the work.  He is still considered the dominant figure in French cameo glass.  He also produced fine pottery, furniture and jewelry, having opened a small woodworkers’ shop in 1884-5, where he experimented in marquetry designs for furniture.  He had an outstanding showing at the Paris Exhibition of 1900, with a working glass furnace at the center of his display.  In 1901, he founded and became the first president of the École de Nancy, an alliance of Lorraine artists that was an important force in French Art Nouveau.  After his death, in 1904, his wife and daughters supervised the firm’s business (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",,,19,"French, 1846–1904",,18042001,,,,,,Emile Gallé,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042001/,,,,,23424819,23424819

"Rhodes studied at the Royal College of Art in London and majored in printed textiles. By the 1970s, she was at the forefront of British fashion with her bold, dynamic, colorful and feminine prints that were seen as anti-establishment in Great Britain.  In 1969, Rhodes set up her own studio and then took a collection to New York where it was featured in American Vogue. As her name became more recognized, she began supplying her work to major American department stores, like Neiman Marcus. She was considered the “Princess of Punk” for her use of tears, holes, and safety pins in her garments. Rhodes has designed jewelry, wrapping paper, and costumes for operas in the United States.

"Chwast studyed drawing with Sidney Delevante at  Cooper Union, graduating with Milton Glaser, Ed Sorel and Reynold Ruffins in 1951.  His drawing style was influenced by Paul Klee, Roualt and Ben Shahn.  After working at the New York Times, Esquire, House and Garden and Glamour magazines, Chwast, with Sorel and Ruffins developed Push Pin Studio in 1954. Producing a wide variety of illustrations, posters, typography and animation, as well as design for packaging, magazines, record albums and book covers, Chwast's designs are a sophisticated blend of raucous colors, and comic book drawing.  Often incorporating inventive typographic juxtapositions appropriated from over a century of handbills, illustrations and advertising, Chwast has influenced a generation of graphic designers and and typographers.  In 1971 He was elected to the Board of Directors, American Institute of Graphic Arts and in 1971-72 he co-designed and directed ""Audience"" magazine.  He was appointed a member of Alliance Graphique Internationale in 1975, the same year he founded Push Pin Press.  He edited and published Push Pin Graphic in 1976, became Director of Pushpin Luballin Peckolick in 1982 and was inducted into the New York Art Directors Club Hall of Fame in 1984.  Since 1985 he has been Director of The Pushpin Group.
He has had many one person exhibitions in New York, California and Florida as well as London, Paris, Vienna, Warsaw and many other European capitals.  In March 1970 Push Pin Studios was the subject of a two month retrospective at the Museé des arts decoratif.  Chwast has been a member of the faculty of the Cooper Union and The School of Visual Arts and also lectures to student and professional groups.",,,34,"American, b. 1931",,18042087,,,,,,Seymour Chwast,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042087/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"The Faience Manufacturing Company was founded in February of 1881 by Bernard Veit, a millinery goods manufacturer and importer, Joseph Offenbach, an exchange broker, Joseph Baruch, Veit’s son-in-law and a former glove manufacturer, and Veit’s sons, Felix and Morris. In their early years the company produced white-bodied earthenware vases, baskets, and jardinières inspired by French faience ceramics, from which the company took their name, and Limoges wares. Production was characterized by hand-molded flowers, painted decoration, and majolica glazes. These wares were at first sold in Veit and Nelson’s showrooms in lower Manhattan. In 1884, Edward Lycett joined as artistic director and introduced new formulas for clay bodies and glazes as well as the use of interchangeable parts and the practice of decorating the same forms with varying designs to increase consumer choice. Lycett dramatically altered the artistic direction of the company. His interest in exotic and historical shapes and designs revitalized the company’s production and responded to rising consumer taste for far and near eastern aesthetics. He supervised about twenty five artisans and at the factory and offered classes in china decoration, a continuation of a tradition that began in the 1860s in his Greene Street studio in downtown New York. New York Faience Company wares were retailed at major arts goods establishments across the country including Tiffany & Company in New York.  In 1886, the company began advertising wares in trade publications oriented towards jewelry and fancy goods wholesalers, as well as periodicals aimed at elite consumers. While these art wares earned critical acclaim, they were expensive to produce and ultimately lead to the downfall of the company. In 1890 the firm reorganized as an agent for a French porcelain manufacturer and two years later ceased production all together.",,,1,"American, 1881-1892",,18061107,,,,,,Faience Manufacturing Company,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18061107/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Battista Franco was a gifted draftsman, engraver, and painter. He was born in Venice and studied in Rome early in his career. Franco’s primary influence was Michelangelo and he is thought to be the first to copy the frescos in the Sistine Chapel. Franco’s interest extended to classical antiquity and he endeavored to record all of the classical sculptures held in private collections in Rome. His extraordinary draftsmanship earned him commissions with Raffaello da Montelupo on the Ponte Sant’Angelo project, grisaille scenes from Roman history at the Porta San Sebastiano, and he worked with Giorgio Vasari on the decoration of the Palazzo Medici in June 1536. (In fact, much of the primary information on Franco comes from Vasari, who dedicated a chapter to him in the Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects that details his influences and major projects in Rome and in Venice.) Franco was appointed personal painter to Cosimo de’ Medici in 1537 and, between 1545 and 1546, he executed the vault of the choir of the Urbino Cathedral. In addition to numerous fresco commissions, Franco designed works on a smaller scale, notably those for maiolica produced at Casteldurante. As an engraver, Franco is known for numerous plates of allegorical and mythological figures; religious scenes from the life of Christ and that of the Virgin; subjects drawn from antique cameos, saints, and angels; and various scenes depicting Roman antiquity and history. In these works, the influence of Michelangelo and other luminaries of early 15th-century Italian art is evident (a tendency that Vasari criticized).",,,1,"Italian, ca. 1510–1561",,18061137,,,,,,Battista Franco,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18061137/,,,,,23424853,23424853

"Elsie Freund started designing and making jewelry in the early 1950s, working primarily in a small home studio. Many of her works, like the ring, were fashioned by from hammered silver wire. Although she did not received much in the way of national recognition in the 1950s and 60s, she did have an important influence on jewelry designers of the next generation. Her work was shown at the 1965 exhibition, ""Art of Personal Adornment"" at the American Craft Museum.",,,6,"American, 1907–2001",,18042907,,,,,,Elsie Marie Bates-Freund,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042907/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Augustus Charles Pugin possibly came to England during the French Revolution, although the exact circumstances and date of his arrival are not known. In 1792, he 
entered the Royal Academy Schools and worked as a draftsman for John Nash
(1752–1835). In 1799, he exhibited a design for a villa at the Royal Academy. His architectural drawings were outstanding for their clarity and accuracy, and he worked frequently as an illustrator of architectural treatises. Some of his most notable contributions are illustrations for The Microcosm of London (1808) and two volumes of Specimens of Gothic Architecture (1818). After the success of Specimens, Pugin worked for Nash between 1819 and 1824, drawing the plates for The Royal Pavilion at Brighton (1826).

He was not very active as a practicing architect, but probably provided designs for other architects. In 1826–27, he exhibited three designs for cemeteries, and in 1830 he was associated with the layout of the cemetery at Kensal Green, London.

"Ingo Maurer was born May 12, 1932 in Germany on the island of Reichenau in Lake Constance. Maurer's early training and artistic career began in the field of graphic design, and he relocated to the United States in 1960 where he worked as a graphic designer in both New York and Los Angeles. In 1963 Maurer returned to Germany and founded the lighting manufactury ""Design M"", later renamed ""Ingo Maurer GmbH"" in Munich. The company continues to create Maurer's eclectic and innovative lighting designs.

"Charles Francis Annesley Voysey (1857-1941) was an English architect, furniture and textile designer. After working for various architects, including George Devey’s country-house design firm, he set up his own practice in 1881. While waiting for architectural commissions, Voysey produced wallpaper and textile designs, working under contract for companies such as Essex & Co. and Alexander Morton. In 1884 Voysey was elected to the Art Worker’s Guild, and in the same year became engaged to Mary Maria Evans. Voysey designed a house for himself and his future wife, and although the house was never built, the plans were published in the Architect (1888) which led to other commissions for small houses. While primarily an architect, Voysey had his greatest impact on textile and wallpaper design. His designs were based on extensive study of observed botanical forms, articulated in light, clear, flat colors and defined outlines; he also used varying bird forms which in effect became the Voysey trademark. His work was uncomplicated but skillfully executed, reflecting crucial ideas from the Arts and Crafts Movement. Voysey’s work as an architect and a designer was based on deep religious faith, seen in his respect for God-given forms and in the symbolism of his designs. He became a member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, exhibiting watercolor and printed fabric designs in the exhibitions of 1888 and 1889. In 1936, Voysey was the first to receive the Designer for Industry award by the Royal Society of Arts. In 1940, a year before his death, he received the RIBA Gold Medal.",,,2,"English, 1857 - 1941",,18046811,,,,,,Charles Francis Annesley Voysey,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046811/,,,,,23424975,23424975

In 1976, she moved to New York, and two years later joined Colab, an artists’ collective that was devoted to making art accessible through exhibitions. Her works typically evoke the human body. Smith’s first artistic works were screen-printed dresses, scarves, and shirts often with images of body parts.

"Ilmari Tapiovaara studied industrial and interior design at the Institute of Industrial Arts in Helsinki, graduating in 1937. His designs reflect his conviction that an object’s function and structural conception should be readily visible. He developed an aesthetic that incorporated influences of the architects and manufacturers that he worked for, each a major figure of mid-century modern style: Alvar Aalto, in Artek’s London Office (1935–36); Le Corbusier in Paris (1937); and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in Chicago (1952–53). Tapiovaara was a pioneer in the design of low cost “knock-down” furniture for Finland’s expanding postwar exports of the late 1940s through 1950s. In addition to its affordability, the furniture’s components could be efficiently packed for overseas shipping and could be easily assembled after delivery.

Tapiovaara became particularly well known for functional furniture such as the stackable, bentwood Domus (1947) and Lukki I (1951) chairs that he initially designed for institutional use at the Domus Academy and the Tech Student Village, respectively. He also earned a reputation as a practical businessman. He served as art director for the furniture firm of Askon Tehaat (1937–40), and later for the major furniture manufacturer Asko (1938–41). He founded the cabinetwork factory of Keravan Puuteollisuus (1941–51), and maintained creative and commercial control by serving as both artistic and managing director. In addition to these business activities and teaching, he and his wife, Annikki, set up their own design consultancy firm (1950), which accepted furniture and industrial design commissions from a variety of companies. Though best known for his designs of interiors and furniture, he also designed lighting, glass, cutlery, carpets, textiles (often in collaboration with his wife), and radio and stereo components, through the mid-1970s.

Mid-20th century Scandinavian design exerted a remarkable and enduring influence on modern design. Finnish designers, such as Tapiovaara, contributed significantly to the development of the modern aesthetic.",,,3,"Finnish, 1914 - 1999",,18056281,,,,,,Ilmari Tapiovaara,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18056281/,,,,,23424812,23424812
"Max Bill, a Swiss painter, sculptor, and designer, is one of the seminal figures in 20th-century Swiss graphic design and typography. Bill is most famous for his graphic interpretation of Bauhaus and constructivist ideals. His designs from the mid-1930s for the Zurich Kunstgewerbemuseum show his application of geometric forms and an ordered compositional layout directly inspired by the graphic and typographical innovations of Herbert Bayer, his mentor at the Bauhaus from 1927 to 1929. 

Bill studied at the Zurich Kunstgewerbeschule from 1924 to 1927 and at the Bauhaus in Dessau from 1927 to 1929. Bill returned to Zurich in 1929, where he became instrumental in the development of the constructivist ideal in Swiss graphic design. He was the co founder and director of the Ulm School of Arts and Crafts (1931–56), an institution dedicated “to improve the quality, form and functionality of commodities made in Germany.”[1] Bill was also the head architect of the Building and Design Sectors for the Swiss National Exhibit in Lausanne (1961–64) and was a professor at the State School for Fine Arts in Hamburg in 1967.

"A potter and a porcelain painter, Dalpayrat was born in Limoges in 1844, and went to the School of Drawing and the Municipal School of Painting on Chinaware, after which he worked in Limoges and Monte Carlo. He established his workshop in Bourg-la-Reine in 1889, with his wife and three (later four) sons. He specialized in stoneware with high-temperature flambé glaze and perfected a copper oxide red glaze that became known as ""Dalpayrat red,"" which he combined with yellows along with rich greens, blues and purples to achieve a marbled effect. This brought him considerable attention at the 1892 salon, and in 1893 he won a gold medal at the Chicago International Exhibition. He went on to make highly acclaimed pieces, some of them set with silver by Parisian jewelers like Cardeihac and Keller, and some of his work for Bing was further decorated with bronze mounts by Edouard Colonna. In 1906, Dalpayrat's workshop closed for financial reasons. He died four years later.",,,3,"French, 1844 – 1910",,18045027,,,,,,Adrien Dalpayrat,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045027/,,,,,23424819,23424819

"Established in 1997, Experimental Jetset is a small independent graphic design studio in Amsterdam, founded by members Marieke Stolk, Erwin Brinkers and Danny van den Dungen. Prior to establishing the firm, Marieke, Erwin and Danny were designing small projects well before they went to art school. Their early work takes its inspiration from punk rock movements and modernism, both of which are still present in their graphic aesthetic.  As teenagers, they claimed to have been “completely absorbed” by all kinds of post-punk movements: psychobilly, garage punk, new wave, two tone, and American hardcore. They were drawn to  the music, as well as to the graphic manifestations that came with it, such as record sleeves, t-shirts, patches, band logos, posters, among others. 

Today their inspirations remain modernism and rock culture. Their portfolio consists of printed works and site-specific installations that have been exhibited at various institutes and group exhibitions, such as ‘Ecstatic Alphabets/ Heaps of Language’ at MoMA (2012), ‘Graphic Design: Now in Production’ at the Walker Art Center (2011). Solo exhibitions include: ‘Kelly 1:1’ in the Casco Projects in Utrecht (2002), and ‘Two or Three Things I Know About Provo’ in Amsterdam (2011), and Cooper Hewitt. Experimental Jetset’s methodology is best described as “turning language into objects.”

In 2011, The Whitney Museum of American Art commissioned Experimental Jetset to design their new graphic identity (similar to a graphic “toolbox”) that was to be used by the in-house Whitney Museum designers. Their work is held in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York.",,,16,"Amsterdam, Netherlands, founded 1997",,18065251,,,,,,Experimental Jetset,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18065251/,,,,,23424909,23424909

"Victor Moscoso (Spanish, b. 1936, active United States) studied at the Cooper Union in New York City and later at Yale University where he studied with Josef Albers. The influence of Albers is evident in Moscoso's use of contrasting color to creat enhanced visual effects. In 1959 he attended the San Francisco Art Institute.  In 1966, he designed posters for venues in San Francisco where rock bands of the burgeoning psychedelic movement played, notably Family Dog dances staged at The Avalon Ballroom. He created a series, titled Neon Rose, for Matrix, a San Francisco nightclub.",,,4,"Spanish and American, b.1936",,18056695,,,,,,Victor Moscoso,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18056695/,,,,,,

"Luis Vega De Castro was born October 4, 1944 in Havana, Cuba. At a young age he enrolled in the Villate School of Art, and by fourteen he began working as a graphic assistant. Based on his experiences within the field as a teenager, Vega received a job designing posters for movies at the Cuban Institute of the Art and Industry of Cinematography (ICAIC).   He studied in the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes San Alejandro, Havana, Cuba, and received his degree in art history, from Havana University, in 1979. Shortly after, Vega emigrated to Miami, where he currently resides. 
Over the years Vega has been garnered with numerous distinctions. In 1972 he won two poster contests in Cuba. Then, in 1981 and 1982, he received the first prize for drawing from the Association of Art Critics and Commentators in Miami. Vega was also awarded a Cintas Fellowship, offered to Cuban descendants, living outside of Cuba, for the purpose of encouraging and promoting the artist’s work. Vega’s work has been exhibited in numerous group shows across the United States, including Miami and New York, as well as exhibitions in Mexico City, Barcelona, Paris, and various cities throughout Italy, Hungary, and Japan highlighting his poster work from his years in Cuba.",,,2,"Luis Vega De Castro, Cuban, b. 1944",,18043375,,,,,,Luis Vega De Castro,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043375/,,,,,23424793,23424793

Lustig’s subsequent work evolved to adapt the powerful, visual language of cubism, constructivism, Dada, the Bauhaus, surrealism, biomorphism, and abstraction to designs for book jackets, identity programs, record covers, and interiors.

As Donald Albrecht wrote in his 2001 Cooper Hewitt exhibition, ""Russel Wright: Creating American Lifestyle,"" Wright’s “inexpensive, mass produced dinnerware, furniture, appliances, and textiles were not only visually and technically innovative but were also the tools to achieve his concept of ‘easier living’, a unique American lifestyle that was gracious yet contemporary and informal.” The Cooper-Hewitt has over one hundred works in the collection by Wright, from a design drawing for flatware to extensive examples from his American Modern line of tableware and serving accessories.",,,101,"American, 1904–1976",,18043357,,,,,,Russel Wright,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043357/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Ruth Reeves trained as a painter and textile designer at Pratt Institute, San Francisco School of Design, and the Art Students League between 1910 and 1915. In 1920 she traveled to Paris, and from 1921 – 27 studied at the Académie Moderne under Fernand Léger. There, she was influenced by modernist movements in painting, but was also exposed to the textile designs of Raoul Dufy and probably Sonia Delaunay, a frequent visitor to Léger’s studio. Designs like Manhattan (1930) and Still Life with Figures (1930) show the influence of cubism, as does her best-known work, the carpeting and wallcoverings for Radio City Music Hall (1932), commissioned by Donald Deskey. 
In 1934, as an Art Research Fellow of the Carnegie Institution, she traveled to Guatemala to study textile and clothing production, and in 1935 created an exhibition of the costumes and textiles she collected there, alongside her own adaptations of the designs, in the R.C.A building. Lewis Mumford called them “probably the most interesting work any designer has offered for commercial production today."" She returned to Guatemala under the auspices of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in 1940 – 41, “Appointed for studies of the textiles, ancient and modern, of South America, and creative work in the same field.”  
In addition to these grant-funded activities, Reeves conceived, along with Romana Javitz, the Index of American Design, a WPA project, and served as its superintendent in 1936 – 37. The Index hired hundreds of artists was to make documentary illustrations of folk, popular, and decorative art that American designers could consult in their search for an authentically American design vocabulary. The Index remains today the most complete survey of American folk and popular art.
Reeves’s work was exhibited widely throughout the 1930s and 40s, including at the Brooklyn Museum, the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, and the Museum of Modern Art, New York, to name a few. She was among the first scholars to receive a Fulbright scholarship to India in 1956, where she lived until her death in 1966. There, she served on the All-India Handicrafts Board, studied and collected Indian crafts. Her collection of Indian folk art resides at the Syracuse University Art Museum.",,,16,"American, 1892–1966",,18043309,,,,,,Ruth Reeves,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043309/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Born in Budapest in 1906, Eva Stricker entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts at age 17, intending to become a painter, but her mother prevailed upon her to learn some trade whereby she could earn a living, the world of fine art being chancy. Eva apprenticed herself to a traditional potter and began learning her trade. The life of the apprentice in any of the trades was not always easy or pleasant, but Eva persisted and soon graduated to journeyman status. Just a year after that her work was displayed at the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial, where she won an honorable mention. By then she was working as a designer in the Kispester Factory in Budapest. She then advertised in the trade papers that she was a qualified journeyman seeking a position and received several responses. When asked recently why she chose the particular job she did she replied, ""Because it was the furthest from home."" She wanted to travel and widen her experience of the world and at the same time increase her skills. She moved to Berlin, then on to other factories in Hamburg and throughout Europe. In 1932 she went to Russia on vacation in order to experience the new artistic and social movements there, as did many other idealistic young artists and intellectuals. As an experienced industrial designer she was soon offered a position assisting in the modernization of the ceramic industry, where her creativity and dynamism stood her well. She traveled to many parts of Russia in order to understand and coordinate the efforts to create a central manufactory which would make products for the homes of the everyday citizenry. Her efforts were recognized, and she was soon transferred to the Lomonosov factory in Leningrad (the former Imperial Porcelain Factory). This in turn led to her appointment as Artistic Director for the Porcelain and Glass Industries for the entire country.

In 1936, however, she was caught up in one of the Stalinist purges, accused of plotting against the life of Stalin. She was imprisoned in the NKVD prison for 16 months, most of that time in solitary confinement. She was subjected to early forms of brainwashing, torture, and the constant possibility that each day would be her last. (Arthur Koestler, a lifelong friend, based his book ""Darkness at Noon"" on her prison experiences.)

Then one day she was unexpectedly led out of her cell to what she feared would be her execution. She was instead put on a train to Austria. Just as the reason for her imprisonment was never really known, so was the reason for her release.

Once in Austria, she left on the last train out at the time of the Anschluss and went to England, where she married Hans Zeisel, who had waited seven years for her. They then went to New York in 1938, where they settled permanently.

One of her first designs in the US was for Sears, Roebuck. She has since designed for Hall China, Red Wing China, Castleton China, Norleans Meito (Japan), Western Stoneware, Hyalyn, Phillip Rosenthal (Germany), Mancioli (Italy), Federal Glass, Heisey Glass, Noritake (Japan), and Nikkon Toki (Japan), and almost too many others to mention. 

Honors collected by Zeisel include a commission from Castleton China and The Museum of Modern Art to design a line of fine porcelain dinnerware, which was presented in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in l947. She has received a senior award from the National Endowments for the Arts (l982), and was the subject of a touring exhibition sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs de Montreal, in l984. She taught ceramic arts industrial design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn from l939 to l952. 
 
Her works are in the permanent collections of Brohan Museum, Berlin; The British Museum; The Brooklyn Museum; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; The Museum of Modern Art; the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and numerous others. She has had retrospective exhibitions in dozens of museums, has lectured widely, and has received two honorary doctorates in recognition of her work, among other honors.

The Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art both issued new releases of some of her early designs in new glazes and colors, always supervised by Zeisel. Her recent works include designs for the Zsolnay Factory in Pecs and Kispester-Granit in Budapest, as well as the American firms of KleinReid, Nambe, and Crate and Barrel. She produced new designs regularly, right up to the time of her death in 2012, at age 105.",,,164,"American, b.

"Since 1966, Lippard has published 20 books on feminism, art, politics and place and has received numerous awards and accolades from literary critics and art associations. A 2012 exhibition on her seminal book, Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object at the Brooklyn Museum, titled ""Six Years"": Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art"", cites Lippard's scholarship as its point of entry into a discussion about conceptual art during its era of emergence, demonstrating her crucial role in the contemporary understanding of this period of art production and criticism. Her research on the move toward dematerialization in art making has formed a cornerstone of contemporary art scholarship and discourse.

Co-founder of Printed Matter (an art bookstore in New York City centered around artist's books), the Heresies Collective, Political Art Documentation/Distribution (PAD/D), Artists Call Against U.S. Intervention in Central America, and other artists' organizations, she has also curated over 50 exhibitions, done performances, comics, guerrilla theater, and edited several independent publications the latest of which is the decidedly local La Puente de Galisteo in her home community in Galisteo, New Mexico.",,,1,"American, b. 1937",,18043217,,,,,,Lucy Lippard,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043217/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"David Lance Goines was born in Oregon in 1945. He was drawn to the graphic arts by his interest in calligraphy prior to enrolling at the University of California, Berkley from which he was expelled at age nineteen for participating in the Free Speech Movement.  At the Berkley Free Press he worked as an apprentice pressman and also wrote, printed and bound a book on calligraphy there. After studing in London for a year, he returned to Berkely and opened a graphic design studio.
Goines purched the Berkley Free Press in 1971 and renamed it the Heironymous Press.

"Herter Brothers was the foremost American firm in the production of high-quality Renaissance Revival and Aesthetic Movement furniture.  The German-bornHerter Brothers, Christian (1839-1883) and Gustave (1830-1892) Herter, were  highly-skilled craftsmen who worked in New York during the second half of the nineteenth century. Gustave emigrated from Wurttemberg in 1848, and already owned what was a leading cabinet-making and interior decorating company by the time he was joined by Christian in 1859.  Christian became a full partner in what became Herter Brothers in 1864, after which the firm's business greatly expanded.  Despite this, Christian spent some time in France in 1868-9, and in 1870 went to England.  The firm took advantage of the Herters' European training and knowledge of style there to create cosmopolitan interiors and furniture for clients all over the United States, and even in England, as their business developed.",,,2,"New York, New York, ca. 1865–82",,18062991,,,,,,Herter Brothers,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18062991/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"The Werkstätte-Produktiv-Genossenschaft von Kunsthandwerkern in Wien (Art-Craft Workshop Cooperative in Vienna), more popularly known as the Wiener Werkstätte, was founded in 1903 by Secession members Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser. As much a movement as a financial enterprise, it had support from the artist Gustav Klimt and the architect Otto Wagner. The workshop was founded on the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the principles of C. R. Ashbee’s Guild of Handicraft. The Werkstätte’s goals were to fulfill the ideals of the guild system: to establish a direct relationship between designers, craftspeople, and the public by producing well-designed domestic goods and reversing the decline in the quality of handmade objects. They rejected machine production, which resulted in costly products and ultimately thwarted widespread public access. The textile and fashion divisions were founded in 1909 and 1910, respectively, at a time when there was a renewed interest in figurative representation rather than geometric design. The workshop dissolved in 1932.",,,754,"Vienna, Austria, 1903 - 1932",,18048101,,,,,,Wiener Werkstätte,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18048101/,,,,,23424750,23424750

"Husband-and-wife design team Charles and Ray Eames were formative and among the most influential figures in American design of the mid-twentieth century. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Charles Eames (1907–78) trained as an architect and worked early in his career for engineers, which evolved into a lifelong interest in mechanics and the complexities of how things worked. Bernice Alexandra (Ray) Kaiser Eames, (1912–88) born in Sacramento, California, had an interest in the abstract, and in the 1930s studied painting under Hans Hofmann in New York. Their interests and visions would blend seamlessly into the creation of influential, lasting designs. Together, the Eameses embraced the  concept of modern design as an agent of social change, creating designs for the overlapping needs of client, society, and designer and developing products that would serve all three. 

Ray and Charles Eames met in September 1940, after Ray entered the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where Charles was already studying, and would soon become head of the industrial design department. He was working with fellow designer Eero Saarinen on an entry for the Museum of Modern Art's ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings"" exhibition/competition; Ray assisted in preparing drawings, and the result was a first-place-winning molded plywood chair. 

Charles and Ray were married in 1941 and moved to California. By 1943 they opened an office in a renovated garage, from where they worked together until Charles's death in 1978, and where Ray alone continued the practice until her death in 1988. They pioneered technologies, and adapted what had been considered ""industrial"" materials to office and domestic environments. Most notably, they developed a method for bending plywood in multiple directions, a continuation of the efforts begun at Cranbrook. During WWII, the Eameses worked for the US Navy--which granted them access to new synthetic glues--and applied their molded-plywood experiments to develop splints for injured troops, replacing the unhygienic, stiff metal ones previously used. After the war, they used this knowledge and experience to create their now-famous molded-plywood chairs and tables. Originally intended for Evans Products, the furniture was produced and marketed by Herman Miller beginning in 1946. That same year, the Museum of Modern Art in New York granted its first one-man show to Charles Eames, discrediting Ray's contributions to their work, a slight that would have lasting historical consequences. Their work was also presented in MoMA's ""Good Design"" shows of the 1950s. Their plywood and modular furniture, which sold well in its heydey, remain icons of midcentury American modern design today, and is still produced by Herman Miller today.",,,8,"American, 1912–1988",,18050087,,,,,,Ray Eames,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050087/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"The firm was founded in 1883 in the Hague and produced art pottery for both decorative and utilitarian purposes, playing an important role in disseminating the modern Art Nouveau style in the Netherlands.  It took on a new ceramic style under the directorship of Th. A.C. Colenbrander and then, from 1894/5, under J. Jurriaan Kok, under whom the firm developed a line of egg shell porcelain, introduced in 1899, and displayed in the Rozenburg pavilion at the 1900 Paris Exposition.  This was an extremely thin and lightweight earthenware, strengthened by glazing inside and out.  The technique involved biscuit heating of the bare shard at a very high temperature (up to c. 1500 C) [during which the shard received the nonporous skin necessary to hold the subtle painting] and then  polish-heating of the glazed shard at a lower temperature.  The decoration consisted of images, often in a stylized naturalistic manner, of flowers, insects, birds, etc., along with open spaces in white or cream (occasionally light blue) and backgrounds showing the influence of Javanese batik.  The products were tea, coffee and chocolate services, of which octagonal cups became best known, along with vases, plates, and ornamental products.  The decorations were designed by a few master painters, especially Samuel Schellink and J. W. van Rossum, who worked there during most of the firm’s existence, along with designs provided by Sterken and others.  The designs were applied in pencil and then one or more painters would complete the decoration.  The process resulted in the products being expensive; despite wide public acceptance, sales declined as economic conditions worsened.  The firm ceased production in 1914 and was liquidated in 1917 (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",,,18,Active 1883–1913,,18048495,,,,,,Rozenburg Pottery and Porcelain Factory,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18048495/,,,,,23424909,23424909

"Virginia Restemeyer earned a BFA from the College of Mt. St. Joseph, Cincinnati, OH, and an MFA from Mason Gross School of the Arts, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ. She started her career as a woodcarver. Then she turned to creating one-of-a-kind lamps, assemblages or sculptures. Using everyday objects liked discarded 1950s kitchen products and old vases to assemble her sculptures, Restemeyer says she pokes fun at women’s previous household role. By giving the objects a new function and a new importance, she transforms old feminine symbols into objects with new roles.",,,1,"American, b. 1951",,18048489,,,,,,Virginia Restemeyer,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18048489/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Although he was perhaps better known as an architect and furniture designer, Josef Frank also designed more than 200 textiles between 1909 and 1950. He was familiar with the business from an early age: his father, Ignaz Frank, was a partner in a large textile production firm and his mother was a highly skilled embroiderer whose work was shown at the 1925 Exposition des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris. Frank produced his first textile design while still studying architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Vienna. 

Frank’s interest in pattern design was not unique among Viennese architects; like Josef Hoffmann, Koloman Moser, Otto Czeschka, and Dagobert Peche, he produced several early designs for the Wiener Werkstätte. Unlike other Wiener Werkstätte designers who created a unified design scheme by using the same pattern throughout an interior—on textiles, wallcoverings, and even fashion—Frank preferred an eclectic combination of fabrics in his interiors. With Oskar Wlach, he opened a retail shop, Haus & Garten, which offered furniture, textiles, rugs, and interior design services. Wlach ran the business side and Frank served as principal designer. 

Amid rising anti-Semitism in Austria, in 1933 Frank accepted an offer from Estrid Ericson to work as chief designer for the Swedish interior design firm Svenkst Tenn, and moved with his family to Sweden. By the late 1930s, his work with the firm was closely associated with Swedish modern design, in particular his light, unpretentious cotton prints strongly influenced by Indian chintz fabrics, botanical drawings, and field guides.",,,4,"Austrian, active Sweden, 1885 - 1967",,18046343,,,,,,Josef Frank,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046343/,,,,,23424750,23424750

"Milton Glaser has been the dean of American graphic design since the 1970s and 1980s, and certainly after the death of Paul Rand in 1996, whose mantle in some respects he inherited. Glaser, like Rand, is known for his intelligent approach to design, saying the most with minimal means. His ubiquitous I [heart] New York logo parallels Rand’s rebus corporate identity for IBM. 

Trained at the Cooper Union (1948–51), Glaser founded the widely influential Push Pin Studios in New York with fellow graduates Seymour Chwast, Edward Sorel, and Reynold Ruffins. Push Pin Studios celebrated eclectic and eccentric design in an era dominated by Swiss rationalism. In the late 1960s, Glaser, with Clay Felker, created New York Magazine; Glaser served as its president and design director until 1977. In 1974, he founded Milton Glaser Inc., which produces corporate and print identity programs. According to Glaser’s website, as of 2007 he has designed more than 300 posters, interiors, and identities for restaurants, supermarkets, and hotels. In 1983, together with Walter Bernard, Glaser created WBMG, a design studio dedicated to magazine and newspaper identities including ParisMatch, the Nation, Esquire, and Jardin des Modes. Glaser has also taught at the School of Visual Arts in New York City and has been the subject of many museum exhibitions. In 2004, he received the National Design Award for lifetime achievement.",,,48,"American, b. 1929",,18042107,,,,,,Milton Glaser,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042107/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Dorothy Hafner was trained as a painter and sculptor; in 1973, she produced her first pieces of ceramic, which she saw as both sculptural and functional. From then on, she has created over 12 collections of tableware for firms such as Tiffany & Co. and Rosenthal, where became the first woman designer at the company.  While Hafner worked on these lines, she also produced several sculptures that were exhibited internationally. Best known for her “Flash” dinnerware, for Rosenthal, Hafner became a household name in the design industry. After a trip to the Great Barrier Reef in 1991, she turned to glass mosaic technique to mimic the brilliant colors and transparency of the ocean. In 1997, Hafner shifted her focus from three-dimensional glass sculptures to flat glass, almost canvas-like. She has exhibited throughout her career, and has won many awards for her unique designs. She has also been commissioned to produce glass window and wall works, and ceramic floor and tile pieces around the United States.",,,9,b. 1952,,18044139,,,,,,Dorothy Hafner,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044139/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Born The Hague 10/4/1885; died 1989

Dutch architect and graphic designer Hendrikus Wijdeveld  was an important force in the creation of Dutch modernist design. As an architect, he was a member of the expressionist movement that opposed the De Stijl group. As a graphic designer, he founded and edited the innovative Dutch periodical Wendingen (published between 1918 and 1931), for which he designed most of the covers and layouts. Cooper-Hewitt’s library holds many issues of Wendingen. Wijdeveld’s characteristic bold, decorative, block-like typeforms and ornamental borders, which became known as the “Wendingen style,” influenced Dutch graphic design well into the 1940s. Wijdeveld also designed posters, some of which have become icons in graphic design history.",,,3,"Dutch, 1885–1987",,18052005,,,,,,Hendrikus Theodorus Wijdeveld,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18052005/,,,,,23424909,23424909

"Fashion designer Txell Miras is based in Barcelona. She received a fine arts degree from the University of Barcelona, then studied fashion design at the Llotja Arts School of Barcelona, and graduated with an MA from Milan’s Domus Academy. There, Txell studied under Neil Barrett, the designer who created Prada for Men. In 2004, she launched her own label. As a former ballet dancer, Txell looks at fashion with the eye of a dancer, being a former ballet dancer herself, her clothes move with the human body, but they also have somewhat of a conceptual aspect referencing art, literature, music and cinema.",,,1,Spanish,,18063631,,,,,,Txell Miras,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18063631/,,,,,23424950,23424950

"Mrs. Mary Bryant Brandegee (née Pratt) was a descendant of the prominent Weld family of Massachusetts. She and her first husband, Congressman Charles F. Sprague, owned a large estate in Brookline, Massachusetts, where later in life she would avidly breed and raise pedigreed poodles. The manor included an Italian garden that would prove influential among American designers during the early decades of the 20th century. It was among the first realized projects by the soon-to-be prominent landscape architect Charles A. Platt, who was hired after the family clashed with and dismissed the Olmsted Brothers from the project. Charles died in 1902 while Mary and their two daughters were traveling in Egypt and, a few years later, she married a former friend of her deceased husband, Edward D. Brandegee, a manufacturer of men's clothing. In 1938, the museum acquired from the again-widowed Mrs. Brandegee an enormous and important collection of mostly Italian drawings that she had bought in 1904 from Giovanni Piancastelli, the director of the Borghese Gallery in Rome. The Hewitt sisters had also purchased, in 1901, a large group of drawings from Piancastelli, and Brandegee’s contribution served to largely reunite the extraordinary collection.",,,6578,"American, 1871–1956",,18049797,,,,,,Mrs. Edward D.

"Adelgunde “Gunta” Stölzl was a very significant and prolific German weaver who was instrumental in shifting the focus of the Bauhaus weaving workshops from pictorial works to industrial-ready designs. Her textiles are renowned for their color, their abstract and asymmetrical composition, and their incorporation of new materials.

Stölzl studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich prior to entering the Bauhaus in 1919. At the Bauhaus, her courses with Paul Klee influenced her bright and lively color palette and the horizontally-aligned compositions that she would use in her woven art of the 1920s and 30s. By 1925, she was appointed craft master of the weaving workshop, which she ran with Georg Muche; she became the master of the weaving workshop upon Muche’s departure in 1927. Due to mounting political pressure, Stölzl was asked to step down in 1931. She moved to Zurich where she continued weaving, founding S P H Stoffe with fellow Bauhaus students Gertrude Preiswerk and Heinrich-Otto Hürlimann. After the departure of Hürlimann in 1937, she ran the workshop under the name Handweberei Flora (Flora Handweaving Mill). The company existed for 30 years, after which Stölzl continued weaving independently until her death.",,,3,"German, 1897–1983",,18052861,,,,,,Adelgunde (Gunta) Stölzl,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18052861/,,,,,23424829,23424829

"She was born in Munich and enrolled at the Kunstgewerbeschule in 1914. During the war, she volunteered as a nurse for the Red Cross. After the war, she returned to her studies and encountered the Bauhaus manifesto; from then on, she continued her studies at the Bauhaus school, having received a scholarship to attend. Stölzl was responsible for developing and launching the weaving workshop at the Bauhaus when it moved from Weimar to Dessau.  In 1925, she became the weaving director and instructed many students on weaving and dyeing techniques. In 1929, she married Arieh Sharon, an Israeli architecture student and in 1931, because of Nazi pressure, Stolz was forced by director Mies van de Rohe to resign from the Bauhaus school. That same year, she moved to Zurich and founded a private handweaving workshop which received some important commissions.",,,1,"German, 1906–1981",,18052859,,,,,,Lena Bergner,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18052859/,,,,,23424829,23424829

"TAR/Tillett and Rauscher Inc., founded in 2006 by Seth Tillett and Nicole Rauscher, is an experimental textile hand-printing studio in Harlem. Tillett comes from a long line of calico printers in England, and grew up in his parents’ live/work studio on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. His parents, D.D. and Leslie Tillett, of Tillett Fabrics Inc., produced custom textiles for the Jackie Kennedy White House, Babe Paley, and other influential clients. They were also artists and experimenters, and developed a number of unique printing techniques, such as the drag-box, a hand-made tool for creating stripes and plaids without the use of a screen. 
Seth Tillett has worked extensively in film, dance and theater as a dramaturge, set and lighting designer, in addition to creating installations. In 2000, he met Nicole Rauscher, a dancer and choreographer, and the two began collaborating on installations and performances involving graphics and textiles. In 2003, the pair moved to New York City, and Rauscher apprenticed herself to D.D. (Doris) Tillett for the last years of her life, while running Tillett Fabrics. Rauscher continues to print Tillett Fabrics designs on request for interior designers who have been clients for decades, but in 2006, Seth and Nicole founded TAR to develop their own experimental approaches. The resulted in a range of techniques that are so hand-intensive and the results so unique that they call into question the use of the term printing, which implies fast, cheap repetition. By creating tools and techniques with which the design is created directly on the fabric, the pair actively seeks to create non-repeating, non-repeatable patterns which embrace spontaneity and chance.",,,4,"New York, USA, founded 2006",,18065075,,,,,,TAR/Tillett and Rauscher Inc.,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18065075/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Gertrude Gheen Robinson was an interior decorator. In 1914, she founded The Decorators Club, a group of people interested in the art of design and decoration. They would gather at the home of Gertrude to discuss and establish the profession of interior decoration. She, along with several fellow decorators, wrote “A Color Scheme for Every Room,” which taught readers how to decorate different rooms of the home based on color schemes, sponsored by Duco paints. Gheen was interviewed by Ladies’ Home Journal (April 1928). 
She married Phillips Brooks Robinson, son of Edward Robinson, Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",,,1,American,,18065007,,,,,,Gertrude Gheen,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18065007/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"After graduating from Pratt Institute in New York in 1933, Severin Jonassen joined Russel Wright Associates in New York where he designed housewares, furniture, and lighting until 1935. From 1935 to 1945, he worked for General Motors under Harley Earl, as assistant chief designer in the styling section. In 1945, Jonassen returned to New York and set up an independent design firm with accounts at Frigidaire, American Optical Co., and Wheeler Boat Works. During this time, two of his chair models were submitted to MoMA’s Good Design competition and were published in the May 8, 1950 issue of Life magazine. In 1953, Jonassen joined Philco, working under Herbert Gosweiler, for whom he designed versions of what would become the Predicta television housing. Jonassen’s work on the Predicta is considered his most celebrated achievement. Gosweiler and Jonassen later became partners in their own firm (1965–68), with accounts including Bausch & Lomb and Proctor-Silex. After 1968 through his retirement, Jonassen moved from a Philadelphia design firm to reopening his own office in Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania.",,,2,"American, 1913-1998",,18065099,,,,,,Severin Jonassen,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18065099/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Edward Ruscha was born in 1937 in Omaha, Nebraska and moved to Oklahoma City when he was five. After studing art in high school, Ruscha moved to Los Angeles and took classes in graphic design at Chouniard Institute and the Walt Disney school for animators (later CAL Arts). Among his influences are the Dada Movement and the paintings of Jasper Johns and  Robert Rauschenberg. His books ""Twenty Six Gas Stations""(1963) and ""Every Building on the Sunset Strip"" (1966) underscored his interest in the every day aspects of contemporary American life.  In the mid 1960s, under the pseudonym Eddie Russia, he was the designer for the contempory art magazine ARTFORUM.  His prints and paintings of words and simple short phrases link Ruscha to both Pop Art and Post-Modernism.  His hard edged, tightly rendered images, show a   fascination with American trompe l'oeil paintings of the nineteenth century and  photography.",,,2,"American, b. 1937",,18053897,,,,,,Edward Ruscha,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053897/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Roy McMakin is known primarily as a furniture designer, and founder of the Seattle-based firm Domestic Furniture which he opened in Los Angeles in 1987.  Born in Wyoming in 1956, McMakin trained as an artist at the University of California, San Diego, where he was granted an MFA.  His furniture has been called ""hybrid"" in the sense that the forms, whether case or seating furniture, are clean, simple and unembellished, evoking earlier styles, from Shaker to Arts and Crafts to Modern.  However, McMakin combines their elements and proportions in an ambiguous way, provoking the user to think about aesthetic sensibilities, style and their own recollections of style.  McMakin came to prominence when the Getty Center chose to furnish their administrative offices with his designs.",,,4,"American, born 1956",,18057529,,,,,,Roy McMakin,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18057529/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Heath Ceramics was founded by the mid-20th-century ceramist, Edith Heath, who was first celebrated for her Bauhaus-style ceramics in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Heath started the company in 1947 as an effort to combine the simplicity of form and glaze embodied in the work of craft potters with industrially mass-produced wares. She formulated a durable stoneware clay and distinctive glazes for her products. Several Heath dining ware patterns and glazed tiles became classics of the mid-20th-century “California style,” which emphasized a warm informality and ease of use.

By the early 21st century, however, the elderly Heath was no longer running the firm and it was experiencing a decline in business. Designers Robin Petravic and Catherine Bailey, with backgrounds in engineering and product design, respectively, became interested in the company and purchased it in 2003.",,,4,,,18057531,,,,,,Heath Ceramics,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18057531/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Schira received her BFA from RISD, studied at L’Ecole d’Art Decoratif in France, and later got her MFA from the University of Kansas. She traveled around the world, including India, Japan, Virgin Islands and Europe. Schira became interested in Peruvian textiles because the techniques used were nothing like European traditions. In the 1960s and 70s she began experimenting with ikat dyed warp designs, then with weaving strips of aluminum through her works, combining them with fiber warp. In 1973, she began experimenting again, this time using rayon ribbon and pre-dyed tapes. Although she incorporates all these materials, she is still true the traditional technique of flat tapestry hanging. Several public spaces own her large scale tapestries.",,,1,b. 1934,,18057533,,,,,,Cynthia Schira,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18057533/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Wendell Castle has been a craftsman, designer, and educator for over four decades.  His work with exotic materials and beautiful hardwoods in biomorphic forms led to the recognition of handcrafted designer furniture as a major art form in the second half of the twentieth century.  In the 1960s he began experimenting with plastic and fiberglass to create seamless organic shapes in his designs.  He created “Environments for Contemplation” in 1969, an iconic object of the psychedelic period: a laminated oak chair in the shape of a womb-like chamber with a door and padded interior. This work was intended as a performance or happening piece rather than a conventional chair. In the 1980’s Castle began to experiment with Postmodernist theory, producing architectural, polychromatic objects.  Each piece is unique, as he is constantly reinventing and improving his craft. Castle developed an innovative way of constructing furniture in a process now called “stack-lamination,” which allows unrestricted sculptural forms to be articulated. Thousands of Castle’s pieces are housed in private, corporate, and permanent museum collections such as the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Arts and Design in New York. Among his many accolades, Castle has received three honorary doctorate degrees, several grants from the National Endowment of the Arts, and in 2007 he was awarded the Brooklyn Museum’s Lifetime Achievement Award for excellence in design.",,,5,"American, b. 1932",,18050379,,,,,,Wendell Castle,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050379/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Luca Giordano was born in Naples on October 18, 1632.  As apprentice to his father Antonio Giordano, a painter, Giordano first achieved great distinction for his ability to replicate old masters and quickly earned the nickname 'Proteo della pittura.'  His early works were greatly influenced by the Spanish painter Giuseppe Ribera, but there is no concrete proof that Giordano was, in fact, his pupil.  In 1654, Giordano traveled to Rome for the first time and then continued further to Bologna, Parma, and Venice.  In Venice he became greatly inspired by Titian and Veronese.  From these artists Giordano derived his own distinctly airy and decorative composition as well as an appreciation for vibrant colors.  Giordano is distinguished by his large oevre which expands diverse subject including mythological, religious, historical, battle scenes, still lifes, genre, and portraits.  In 1692, Charles II invited Giordano to Spain.  There he was assigned official Court Painter.  For the next ten years, Giordano executed many great works for the King as well as for the nobility including frescoes for S. Lorenzo, El Escorial; Palacio Real and Buen Retino, Madrid; a Cathedral in Toledo; and a Convent in Quadalupe. In 1702 Giordano returned to Naples.  In 1705 he passed away and was buried at the church of S. Brigida, which he had decorated fifty years prior.  The last three years of his life, Giordano executed some of his most important works including the S. Francesco di Sales; S. Carlo Borromeo for Gerolomini church; and perhaps the most influential: the dome of Certosa di San Martino.  This last work opened the doors to 18th century Rococo decorative style.  His stylisitic legacy was passed down through many followers and pupils as 'Giordanismo.'

"Graphic designer and writer, Louise Fili, was born in Orange, New Jersey on April 15th, 1951. In 1973, she graduated from Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York where an opportunity to work in the college typeshop inspired a deep love for typography. Fili specializes in logo, package, restaurant, type, book and book jacket design. She is known for her quiet pretty style of design, often incorperating older less popular typefaces from the 20's, 30's, and 40's. In an article in Print magazine, Phillip B. Meggs described Fili's unique style and process when he wrote, ""Fili's work is elegant and refined, possessing great subtlety and even softness. Often, [the] typeface will be a style she remembers from old typographic specimens or will have to be radically altered to achieve her objectives. For Fili, the sad part of the death of handset metal typography is the loss of many wonderful old typefaces which are simply unavailable. She has worked around this problem by restoring letterforms from old printed specimens, commissioning hand lettering of the missinig letters or even the entire title and message."" 

           Louise fili began her design career in 1976 as a senior designer for Herb Lubalin Associates and left the Lubalin Studio in 1978 in order to accept a position as art director of Pantheon Books. Fili stayed at the Pantheon until 1989 when she left to found Louise fili Ltd. where she is currently principal.

           Although Fili has created over 2,000 book covers to date, much of her most well known work, including the book jacket for Marguerite Duras' ""The Lover"", were created during her time at Pantheon Books. In an article in Print magazine, Phillip B. Meggs described her work at Pantheon when he wrote, ""Color and imagery also seem to resonate with the essence and spirit of the literature, almost as though Fili has focused more on the logo and food package design, especially on the creation of corporate identities for the restaurants including Picholine and Prix Fixe.

          Fili's work has been included in the permanent collection of the Library of Congress, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, and the Musee des Arts Decoratifs. Her work has also been featured in Graphis, Step Inside Design, and Print magazines. Fili has also co-authored many design books with her husband Steven Heller including ""Italian Art Deco"", ""Dutch Moderne"", ""Streamline"", ""French Modern"", ""British Modern"", ""Deco Type"", ""German Modern"", ""Deco Espana"", ""Typology"", ""Belles Lettres"" and ""Cover Story"".",,,26,"American, b. 1951",,18041621,,,,,,Louise Fili,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18041621/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Born in Seattle, WA on April 9, 1954. Active in Seattle.
MoMA, P.S. 1: ""Originally from Tacoma, Washington, Chantry moved to Seattle in the late 1970s and became a singular force in the city’s subculture, designing album covers and posters for the underground music and theater industry. He served as art director for The Rocket, Seattle’s free monthly tabloid and a breeding ground for talented contributors such as Matt Groening of The Simpsons and cartoonist Lynda Barry. His design work for independent record labels, commercial clients and political and community events, always on a low budget and with a quick turnaround, remains influential and much imitated today.
His posters juxtapose large type, often fractured or distressed and lifted from vintage sources, with startling pictures appropriated from clip art, exploitation magazines, and hot-rod culture. Recycling this material to produce work that is simultaneously chaotic and clear, Chantry reminds the viewer that much of what we see in advertising and packaging is born of vernacular culture. Translating the ragged physicality and irreverent humor of punk music into visual form, Chantry, whose methods often mirror his punk aesthetics, avoids using the computer as a design tool and is known for being choosy about the corporate clients for whom he is willing to work.""",,,106,"American, b. 1954",,18041683,,,,,,Art Chantry,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18041683/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Vladimir and Georgii Stenberg were major innovators in the field of modernist graphic design.

Vladimir and Georgii Stenberg were born in Moscow in 1899 and 1900, respectively. They attended the Stroganov School of Applied Art and took classes in military engineering. In the early 1920s, they joined other artists, including Alexander Rodchenko, in an exhibition of constructivist sculpture and painting. The Stenbergs’ contributions were non-objective sculptures of glass, metal, wire, and wood, showing lines and planes floating in space. Their earliest graphic design efforts were for the theater, which the Soviet state supported as a powerful propaganda tool. They provided inventive and graphic costumes and sets for Moscow Chamber Theater productions by George Bernard Shaw, Eugene O’Neill, and Bertolt Brecht. For one production, the Stenbergs included the names of the characters running down the sides of their costumes. 

When the Stenberg brothers turned their attention to film posters, they were influenced by the innovations of Russian and Eastern European designers such as Alexander Rodchenko and László Moholy-Nagy, who had incorporated the technique of photomontage in their work. They were also influenced by the cinematic montage theories of Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein. The Stenbergs, however, did not use photomontage in the conventional way, in which photographs were transposed onto the lithographic plate and then printed. Instead, they projected photographic images with a special projector they invented; this enabled them to enlarge and distort images and turn them in any direction. This device allowed for greater creativity in achieving unusual compositions of fractured, isolated images of different scales and perspectives.

During their career as poster designers—from 1923 through 1933, when Georgii died in a motorcycle accident—the Stenbergs produced over 50 posters, most of which look as fresh today as they must have appeared at the time. The Stenberg brothers have influenced a range of contemporary graphic designers, from the whole Swiss typography movement, Josef Müller-Brockman, Armin Hofmann, April Greiman, and Dan Friedman, to Saul Bass, and Paula Scher.",,,3,"Russian, 1899 - 1982",,18061513,,,,,,Vladimir Augustovich Stenberg,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18061513/,,,,,23424936,23424936

"Hechizoo Textiles, which creates custom textiles for upholstery, rugs, window treatments and paneling, was founded in 2000 by Jorge Lizarazo in Bogota, Colombia. Lizarazo originally worked as an architect, which has influenced his textiles in terms of their structural clarity and use of materials. His designs also benefit from his staff’s diverse expertise in the rich weaving traditions of various regions in South America. Additionally, the staff is trained to work with new and unusual materials that complement the often understated and basic textile structure of the textiles. Hechizoo textiles incorporate both man-made materials, such as metal wire, nylon, and polyester ribbon, with natural materials such as, silk, agave, cumare and penca. The integration of these natural fibers with more industrial products results in the creation of contemporary and sophisticated products.",,,3,"Bogotá, Colombia, founded 2000",,18061505,,,,,,Hechizoo Textiles,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18061505/,,,,,23424787,23424787

"McNish was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, and began painting at an early age. In the 1950s she moved to London and made a career in textile design. She first studied at the London College of Printing and later turned to textiles. As soon as McNish had graduated from the Royal College of Arts in 1957, she was commissioned by Liberty to design furnishing fabrics. She became an important figure in the design world for her unprecedented combinations of patterns and colors. She has been hired to produce several commercial commissions throughout her career, including experimental laminate panels for the SS Oriana liner’s restaurants, textile hangings in dyed cotton velvet for British Railways Board’s offices, and murals and hangings for Royal Caribbean Cruise Line ships. 
As a founding member of the Caribbean Artists Movement, McNish took the Caribbean aesthetic to an international audience. She had a great influenced on British textiles.

"The son of a furniture maker, Joaquim Tenreiro learned traditional wood crafting and joinery techniques in his father’s workshop but became known for breaking with tradition by developing a contemporary formal Brazilian language of design that utilized native materials. 

Tenreiro was born in Portugal but made Brazil his home. In 1928, he married and settled in Rio de Janeiro, where he began making furniture in traditional styles for firms such as Laubisch-Hirth. Tenreiro was also one of the founding members of the Bernardelli Group, formed in 1931 at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes. The Bernadelli Group wanted to raise the status of art as a profession. They broke with entrenched academic conservatism and championed a modernism that combined international art movements, such as cubism and expressionism, with Brazilian social issues and imagery derived from the Brazilian landscape and indigenous peoples.

The late 1930s and early 1940s were seminal years for Tenreiro. During that time, he designed furniture for not only Laubisch-Hirth, but for Leandro Martins and Francisco Gomes as well. In 1941, he received a commission to create furniture for a home designed by Oscar Niemeyer for the writer Francisco Inácio Peixoto, one of many collaborations with the Brazilian architect.

In 1942, Tenreiro broke completely with tradition and created his first chair in the modern style, advocating an idea that Brazilian furniture should express a contemporary formal language. It should be free of excessive ornamentation and designed with the Brazilian climate and way of living in mind, using native hard woods and other materials, such as wicker. Tenreiro’s pieces were constructed by Brazilian woodworkers familiar with native woods and traditional working techniques. During this period, he and a business partner opened their own furniture business, Langenbach and Tenreiro Ltda., in Rio, expanding to a second location in São Paulo to meet the demand for his designs. He continued designing furniture until the late 1960s, when he closed the business to devote himself to painting and sculpture.

"Michael Thonet opened his first cabinetry workshop in a rural Austrian town in 1819, where he experimented with the process of using steam to bend wood for furniture.  Shortly after he founded his company ""Gebruder Thonet,"" or Thonet Brothers (1853).  In 1856, he obtained the first patent for the bentwood process.  Although his patent expired in 1869, by 1900, Thonet owned fifty-two assembly line production factories for bentwood furniture across Europe.  Numerous replicas of his most famous chair, the Viennese cafe chair known as model no. 14, abound today.  A New York office opened in the United States in 1873 and was later sold into subsidiaries, whereas in Europe the Thonet family remained involved in the Art Noveau movement.",,,7,,,18054021,,,,,,Gebrüder (Brothers) Thonet,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18054021/,,,,,23424977,23424977

In 1891 he went to the painting school for the pottery industry in Znaim, then 1894 to the Vienna Industrial Arts School.  In 1906 he founded with Bertold Loffler the workshop ""Wiener Keramik"", which also worked for the ""Wiener Werkstatte"".

"The prominent New York financier and industrialist John Pierpont Morgan served on the Council of the museum (and added regularly to its coffers). But it was Morgan’s earliest contribution, in 1902, that most changed the course of the museum. Morgan reportedly learned of Eleanor and Sarah Hewitt's interest in an important textile collection in Barcelona; shortly thereafter, while traveling in Europe, he nonchalantly purchased three extraordinary collections of textiles: the Badia collection in Barcelona, the Vives collection in Madrid, and the Baron collection in Paris. He donated these in their entirety—more than 1,000 items—to the young museum, making it suddenly among the top holders of textiles in the world. Morgan was later quoted as having explained to Abram, “I do this to give your daughters pleasure.""",Prominent New York financier and industrialist,"The prominent New York financier and industrialist, John Pierpont Morgan, served on the museum’s council and added regularly to its coffers.

A native of Springfield, Massachusetts he studied at the Art Students League in New York City and later at the Woodstock, New York art colony. Cook moved to Taos, New Mexico in the 1930s where he engaged in the art colony there. During his career he received two Guggenheim Fellowships and was elected an Academician in the National Academy of Design. He earned a national reputation as a painter, muralist, and printmaker. 

His career included one-person exhibitions at the Denver Art Museum (1927) and the Museum of New Mexico (1928). Later in his career, Cook became an artist war correspondent in the Pacific theater during World War II.  (exerpted from exhibition text in ""Howard Cook: Prints from the C.

"Michelangelo Fasano was an ornamental painter who worked for the Neopolitan court in the mid-18th century.  He is documented to have provided cartoons for the borders, overwindows and supplements for a set of tapestries for the reception rooms near the bedchamber of Charles of Bourbon, King of Naples at the Reggia di Caserta.  These were executed under the direction of Giuseppe Bonito, painter to the Neopolitan court, at the San Carlo al Mortelle (Neopolitan royal manufactory).  The tapestries are now distributed between the Capodimonte Museum and Gallery in Naples, and the Quirinal in Rome.",,,1,"Italian, active 18th century",,18062091,,,,,,Michelangelo Fasano,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18062091/,,,,,23424853,23424853

"Helena Hernmarck was born in Stockholm, and trained at Stockholm Collect of Arts, Crafts, and Design.
In 1964 she moved to Canada where she was inspired by pop culture, and began producing sculptural public tapestries with spun and dyed yarns from Sweden. She produced large-scale black and white pieces that resembled newspapers. Rather than use the Gobelin technique, she “uses as background a discontinuous plain weave on top of which she hand picks a supplementary pattern weft, according to a grid which at one end totally covers the plain weave (soumac stitch) and allows it to become increasingly exposed” (Sigrid Wortmann Weltge, “Helena Hernmarck,” American Craft (December 1999/January 2000). While the size of her works looks to medieval tapestries, the subject matter is modern and ignores the idea that a tapestry should be flat. Instead, Hernmarck embraces three-dimensionality through color, shadow, and imagery.",,,1,"Swedish, active Sweden and United States, b. 1941",,18059707,,,,,,Helena Hernmarck,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18059707/,,,,,23424954,23424954

"Ryohin Keikaku Company, Ltd., popularly known as Muji, is a Japanese manufacturer and retailer specializing in household and consumer products. The name Muji derives from the Japanese phrase ""mujirushi ryohin"" (""no brand quality goods""). Mujirushi Ryohin started as a product brand of The Saiyu, Ltd. supermarket chain in 1980. In 1983 the first stand-alone Mujirushi Ryohin retail location opened in Japan, with the first international store opening ten years later in London. Muji is now world-wide, with hundreds of locations throughout Asia, Europe, and North America. The company’s design philosophy is distinguished by its emphasis on simplicity, function, selection of materials, efficient manufacturing processes, minimal packaging, recycling, and waste reduction. While Muji products are generally not attributed to individual designers, the firm has worked with notable industrial designers such as Naoto Fukasawa, Konstantin Grcic, and Jasper Morrison. The company’s “no-brand” brand does not rely on traditional advertising to achieve popularity, but on word of mouth from consumers who prefer unpretentious design, reasonably priced quality, and a simple shopping experience.

"Tommi Parzinger was born in Munich and received professional design training there at the school of art and craft, Kunstgewerbeschule. He began his career as a freelance designer of ceramics, wallpapers, lighting, textiles, furniture. He traveled and worked in Germany and Austria, becoming familiar with the modern movements of the day including the Jugendstijl, the Bauhaus, and the Wiener Werkstatte.As a professional designer in Germany he created porcelain for the German firm KPM, as well as posters, textiles, interiors and wallpapers. In 1932 he came to the United Stated as a prize for winning a poster contest for North German Lloyd. In 1935, he settled in New York and became associated with Rena Rosenthal (""smart furniture and accessories shop"") as a designer of china, glassware and furniture. Furniture became his primary focus and in 1938 he became a designer for Charak of Boston. In 1939, he formed his own business, Parzinger, Inc., renamed Parzinger Originals in 1946. Donald Cameron became his partner. In addition, he designed furniture, fabrics, lighting and range of accessories for other firms, including Salterini (wrought iron); Hofstatter (furniture); Dorlyn (brass); Willow & Reed (rattan). He produced custom designs for interior decorators and his many private clients. Parzinger furnishings changed very little over the years. Rooted in Viennese style, the main characteristics of the furniture were simplicity and a sense of proportion, rich wood textures ornamented with handmade hardware. His designs for silver, ceramics, lighting and glassware used light and joyful animal or floral motifs. In 1996 and 1998 his work was shown by Palumbo Gallery, 972 Lexington Avenue, New York City.",,,249,"American, b.

"A young and innovative Russian-born graphic designer, Alexander Gelman works in New York City under the name of Design Machine (formerly Access Factory). His graphic design projects range from corporate identity and type design to promotional materials and packaging.

Before establishing his New York office in 1993, Gelman had already gained attention as a freelance designer in his native Moscow and briefly in Israel. His covers for the Russian design magazine ""Engineering Aesthetics"" were highly praised. Many of the motifs and design ideas first explored in these covers, created through traditional hand-drawn methods, have become starting points for his computer- generated work in the United States. Since establishing his New York office, Alex Gelman has developed a notable roster of clients including Swatch, Exxon, MTV, PBS, and Prodigy. In addition he has functioned as a design consultant for larger firms like Landor Associates and currently teaches graphic design and typography at the Parsons School of Design and at the School of Visual Arts.

Some of his designs have been recently published in:

"Ettore Sottsass was a product designer and architect who had an enormous influence on Italian design in the second half of the 20th century.  Sottsass was born in Innsbruck, Austria but moved with his family to Italy so that he could study architecture at Turin Polytechnic University.  Upon graduating in 1939 he was called to serve the Italian Army until the end of World War II. In 1945, Sottsass opened his own architecture and design studio in Milan. At this time he started designing furniture that experimented with the relationship between three-dimensional space and two-dimensional pattern, a theme that can be seen throughout Sottsass’ career. He worked as a design consultant for the industrial design group Olivetti from 1958-1980, where he created iconic pieces associated with pop culture such as the Elea 9003 calculator and the Valentine portable red typewriter, as well as numerous whimsical objects in glass and ceramic. In 1980, Sottsass co-founded the Milan design group Memphis with fellow avant-garde designers Andrea Branzi, Alessandro Mendini, Martine Bedin, and Michele de Lucchi. Aiming to promote radical design, they produced brightly colored, geometric, and often anti-functional furniture, lighting and ceramics. Memphis dominated the early 1980s design scene and secured Sottsass’ place in history as a founder of post-modernism.  Sottsass left the group in 1985 to focus on his own Milan-based practice, Sottsass Associati, where he worked for the rest of his life. He returned to architecture in his later years to complete a series of private houses and public buildings, notably the interior of the Milan Malpensa 2000 Airport from 1994-1998. In recent years,  Sottsass’ career has been the object of major retrospectives, including exhibitions at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2006 and the London Design Museum in 2007. His works belong to numerous public collections around the world, and continue to inspire young designers.",,,11,"Italian, 1917–2007",,18044261,,,,,,"Ettore Sottsass, Jr.",,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044261/,,,,,23424853,23424853
"Husband-and-wife design team Charles and Ray Eames were formative and among the most influential figures in American design of the mid-twentieth century. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Charles Eames (1907–78) trained as an architect and worked early in his career for engineers, which evolved into a lifelong interest in mechanics and the complexities of how things worked. Bernice Alexandra (Ray) Kaiser Eames, (1912–88) born in Sacramento, California, had an interest in the abstract, and in the 1930s studied painting under Hans Hofmann in New York. Their interests and visions would blend seamlessly into the creation of influential, lasting designs. Together, the Eameses embraced the  concept of modern design as an agent of social change, creating designs for the overlapping needs of client, society, and designer and developing products that would serve all three. 

Ray and Charles Eames met in September 1940, after Ray entered the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where Charles was already studying, and would soon become head of the industrial design department. He was working with fellow designer Eero Saarinen on an entry for the Museum of Modern Art's ""Organic Design in Home Furnishings"" exhibition/competition; Ray assisted in preparing drawings, and the result was a first-place-winning molded plywood chair. 

Charles and Ray were married in 1941 and moved to California. By 1943 they opened an office in a renovated garage, from where they worked together until Charles's death in 1978, and where Ray alone continued the practice until her death in 1988. They pioneered technologies, and adapted what had been considered ""industrial"" materials to office and domestic environments. Most notably, they developed a method for bending plywood in multiple directions, a continuation of the efforts begun at Cranbrook. During WWII, the Eameses worked for the US Navy--which granted them access to new synthetic glues--and applied their molded-plywood experiments to develop splints for injured troops, replacing the unhygienic, stiff metal ones previously used. After the war, they used this knowledge and experience to create their now-famous molded-plywood chairs and tables. Originally intended for Evans Products, the furniture was produced and marketed by Herman Miller beginning in 1946. That same year, the Museum of Modern Art in New York granted its first one-man show to Charles Eames, discrediting Ray's contributions to their work, a slight that would have lasting historical consequences. Their work was also presented in MoMA's ""Good Design"" shows of the 1950s. Their plywood and modular furniture, which sold well in its heydey, remain icons of midcentury American modern design today, and is still produced by Herman Miller today.",,,13,"American, 1907–1978",,18044269,,,,,,Charles Eames,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044269/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"As a teenager, Bennett worked a variety of jobs in New York City’s Garment District. Despite his lack of formal artistic training, he travelled to Paris and drew for haute couture collections. Bennett enrolled at the Istituto d’Arte Porta Romana in Florence before attending the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris in 1937, where he worked with sculptor Constantin Brancusi. Bennett returned to New York several years later and, in the 1940s, began his first forays into interior design while also producing ceramics and jewelry. His debut in the Whitney Museum Annual Exhibition (1944) led to a one-man show at MoMA. 

Two large projects for the interiors and furnishings of the Crown Zellerbach Building in San Francisco (1959) and the Chase Manhattan Bank Building in New York (1961), both by the architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, put Bennett in the design world spotlight. For the Chase commission, Bennett created glass vases, ashtrays, executive china, silverware, furniture, and cabinetry. Some of the furniture designed for these projects was reproduced, beginning in 1964, by Brickel Associates, a relationship that led to Bennett’s appointment as the firm’s resident designer in the 1970s. He obtained many residential interior commissions in New York City and the Hamptons and was well known for the continual redesign of his own two-story apartment in the Dakota building on the Upper West Side, photos of which appeared repeatedly in publications such as Progressive Architecture, Interiors, Domus, and Interior Design. 

After creating a limited-production line of sterling flatware for Tiffany & Company that was commercially unsuccessful, Bennett began a lucrative partnership designing for the Japanese manufacturer Sasaki, contributing at least eight patterns of flatware designs (several examples of which are represented in the museum’s collection), as well as glassware and ceramics that were launched as part of the centennial anniversary of Bloomingdale’s department store in 1986. Bennett became Design Director of the Geiger furniture company in 1987. Prior to his death in 2003, Bennett was honored by the American Institute of Architects for distinguished achievements in design over the course of his nearly 65-year career. He was also inducted into Interior Design magazine’s Hall of Fame.",,,60,"American, 1917–2003",,18044277,,,,,,Ward Bennett,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044277/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Born at Great Marlow, Joseph Nash began his drafting career studying Gothic architecture under Augustus Charles Pugin. He went with Pugin to Paris in 1829 to make drawings for Paris and Its Environs (1830), and lithographed the plates in Pugin’s Views Illustrative of Examples of Gothic Architecture (1830). From 1831 to 1879, he exhibited at the Royal Academy; and exhibited at the 1855 Paris Exposition Universelle, receiving an honorable mention. His early exhibits at the Society of
Painters in Water Colours were mainly illustrations for Shakespeare and contemporary poetry and novels; Tudor and Elizabethan architecture of Knole, Hampton Court, and Speke Hall were also frequent subjects. His published works
include Architecture of the Middle Ages (1838); The Mansions of England in the
Olden Time, published in four sets of twenty-six lithographs (1839–49); Scotland
Delineated (1847–54); and Views of Windsor Castle (1848). (JGK)",,,4,"British, 1808 - 1878",,18050891,,,,,,Joseph Nash The Elder,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050891/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"Trained in the fine arts at the Arnhem School of Art and Industrial Arts from which he graduated in 1961, Karel Martens began work as a book designer for small presses like the Socialistiese Uitgeverij Nijmegen for whom he designed many book covers between 1975 and 1981.  Starting in 1977 he began teaching at ArtEZ College of Art in Arnhem while producing, during the following three decades, designs for the Dutch government including coins, postage stamps and telephone cards. Since the 1990s, Martens’ career has hit many milestones. His work for the architectural magazine OASE has been lauded since he became chief designer in 1990. In 1996 he published, with Jaap van Triest, a celebrated book entitled Printed Matter, containing stunning pages of his digital and traditional letter press design work (now in its third printing).  The book was declared the best designed book in the world by the 1998 Leipzig Book Fair.  Also in 1996, Martens won the Dr. A.H. Heineken Award for the top graphic design in Holland.  In 1997 he initiated Workplaats Typografie (WT) at the Arnhem College of Art, which is a fully functioning graphic design studio run by his graduate students. He has also acted as a visiting professor at Yale University since 1997, hosting an annual three-week intensive in the post-graduate design school.",,,20,"Dutch, b. 1939",,18064377,,,,,,Karel Martens,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18064377/,,,,,23424909,23424909

"Elaine Lustig Cohen was married to Alvin Lustig, a successful Los Angeles graphic designer. He was offered a position at Yale and the two moved to New York City and set up their office. At first Elaine was his secretary and assistant. Despite having been trained in painting and earning a B.F.A., Alvin Lustig did not teach his wife about graphic design. She learned by observation. When Alvin died, seven years after they were married, Elaine took the reins of the business. Having retained Alvin’s clients, including Eero Saarinen and Philip Johnson, who opened many doors for her, she learned not only about how to run a business but about being a successful graphic designer. She got commissions from architects, museums, and other corporations. After disbanding the company, Elaine remarried and, with her husband, Arthur Cohen, a publisher, launched Ex Libris, a bookshop and gallery. In 2011, Elaine was awarded the AIGA medal.",,,120,"American, b. 1927",,18064303,,,,,,Elaine Lustig Cohen,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18064303/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Frederick Hurten Rhead helped pioneer the design of mass-produced ceramic tableware for the home. He is best remembered for the colorful Fiesta line of tableware introduced by The Homer Laughlin China Company in 1936. Moderately priced and available in five bright durable glazes, the popular dinnerware introduced the concept of mixing and matching while also transforming the look of domestic interiors across America. His other designs for Homer Laughlin included kitchen accessories and Harlequin tableware.

A son of one of the leading pottery designers in England, Rhead immigrated to the U.S. in 1902, when the American art pottery movement was just beginning. He worked at several ceramics factories, including Roseville, where he was art director from 1904 to 1908. He also helped establish Jervis Pottery on Long Island and ran a pottery studio at Arequipa, a California sanatorium for women suffering from tuberculosis, where he experimented with glazes. From 1917 to 1927, Rhead was the director of research at American Encaustic Tiling Company in Zanesville, Ohio. He served as art director for Homer Laughlin from 1927 until his death in 1942.",,,25,"American, born England, 1880–1942",,18044327,,,,,,Frederick Hurten Rhead,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044327/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Otto Natzler was born in Vienna in 1908. He worked as a textile designer until 1933, when he met his future wife, ceramics student Gertrud Amon,and became interested in clay. The couple set up a workshop in Vienna and married in 1938. They immigrated to Los Angeles, California, that same year, after Austria was annexed by Germany. Natzler is known for his meticulous glaze experiments, which were applied to the remarkably thin thrown vessels created by Gertrud. Otto's glazes are notable for their incredible range of colors and textures, a result of his detailed and exacting notes taken on all aspects of the glazing and firing processes. After Gertrud's death in 1971 and a year-long hiatus, Otto's work shifted to producing slablike forms which were  vastly different in style from Gertrud's delicately thin work. 

The couple's work as well as Otto's later individual works are included in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art, Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.",,,5,"American, b.

"The Homer Laughlin Pottery Company was founded in East Liverpool, Ohio, by the brothers Homer and Shakespeare Laughlin in 1871, originally under the name of Laughlin Pottery. The brothers recieved $5,000 in seed money from the East Liverpool City Council to build and operate a plant that produced white ware like that being imported from England at the time. Their white granite ware won an award in 1876 at the United States Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. When Shakespeare left the company in 1877, it was renamed the Homer Laughlin China Works. Homer decided to retire in 1897 and sold the business to the Wells family. The company expanded rapidly under the new leadership, adding several more production plants between 1899 and the early 1920s. The brightly colored Fiesta line, designed by Henry Hurten Rhead and introduced in 1936, became the company’s most popular design. The line was discontinued in 1973, but sales in the scondary market were so strong that the company reintroduced it in 1986, marking its fiftieth anniversary.

"Born in Copenhagen, Jens Risom studied furniture design and worked in the design department of Sweden’s largest department store, Nordiska Kompaniet, before immigrating to the United States in 1939. 

Risom became acquainted with Hans Knoll while working for an interior designer and joined Knoll in 1941 to design furniture and oversee fabrication, mainly for commissions by architects and private clients. Determined to expand his business, Knoll assembled Risom’s designs as a featured collection in the company’s first catalog, published in 1942. The product line exhibited the company’s design direction: wood furnishings in a modern idiom. Wartime material shortages did not constrain Risom’s creativity but rather fostered experimentation and resourcefulness: he used material that had been rejected by the government as substandard for military use, but proved quite suitable for residential seating. This can be seen in the use of webbing in place of traditional upholstery on many of Risom’s chairs, and in the use of “regulated” (soft) wood for furniture frames.",,,6,"American, b.

"Tanadori Yokoo is widely considered one of the most important Japanese graphic designers to emerge following World War II. Yokoo began his career as a stage designer for avant-garde theater in Tokyo. His early work reflects the influence of Milton Glaser and Seymour Chwast of Push Pin Studios. Yokoo began producing posters in the mid-1960s. Originally trained as a painter, he selected iconic elements from both western and eastern art to create a visual dialogue representing the synthesis of East and West. At a time when American pop artists, such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, were mining commercial art, commenting on mass production, and revitalizing the relevance of fine art in society, Yokoo created his own conversation between mass production and fine art. 

By the late 1960s, Yokoo became interested in mysticism and psychedelia, which was deepened by a trip to India. While his multilayered graphic work somewhat resembles that of American and English psychedelic graphic designers, his imagery is intensely autobiographical and highly original. Yokoo achieved international recognition demonstrated through his inclusion in the 1968 Word and Image exhibition at MoMA. Four years later, MoMA mounted a monographic exhibition of his work. This was followed by other solo exhibitions at the Museen für Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg (1973) and the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (1974). In 1981, Yokoo gave up commercial work to concentrate on painting, which he continues today along with graphic design.",,,22,b. 1936,,18054231,,,,,,"Tadanori Yokoo, Japanese",,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18054231/,,,,,23424856,23424856

"Herbert Matter was a pioneer in the application of photography in graphic design. Beginning in the 1920s, Matter was sensitive to the manipulative possibilities that the photographic medium held for graphic design. Influenced by the photomontage techniques of John   and other German and Russian artists of the Dada school, Matter quickly adopted a visual vocabulary that capitalized on the juxtaposition of images, text, and isolated areas of color or tone. Matter was known for incorporating photomontage into commercial art to produce sophisticated and memorable images. 

Matter studied with the artists Fernand Léger and Amédée Ozenfant at the Académie Moderne in Paris in 1927, after initially studying fine art in Geneva at the École des Beaux-Arts. While in Paris, Matter worked with the graphic designer A. M. Cassandre and the architect and designer, Le Corbusier. In 1932, Matter returned to Switzerland where he designed posters for the Swiss Tourist Office—the first of which reflects the influence of A. M. Cassandre. Matter came to the United States in 1936 and designed magazine covers for Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue. Matter worked as a staff photographer for Condé Nast from 1945 to 1957, and from 1946 to 1966 he was a design consultant for Knoll. Matter taught graphic design and photography at Yale and, with his wife, Mercedes, a noted photographer in her own right, continued to explore the possibilities of photography and design.",,,2,"Swiss, 1907 – 1984",,18059149,,,,,,Herbert Matter,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18059149/,,,,,23424957,23424957

After graduating from Toyama University, he worked in his father’s textile business which would later   specialize in flock printing, and they have diversified to include other printing techniques using resin and pigment.

"Jun Tomita (b. 1951), a Japanese textile artist, has worked with the traditional dyeing technique of kasuri for over two decades while adding to the medium his own rich and contemporary interpretation. Kasuri, the Japanese word for ikat, which is derived from the Malay-Indonesian word mengikat meaning “to tie or to bind”, has been popular in Japan since the 17th century. Ikat however, was established much earlier, and was used only in very special circumstances on clothing worn mainly by the aristocracy.",,,1,"Japanese, b. 1951",,18061367,,,,,,Jun Tomita,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18061367/,,,,,23424856,23424856

"Upon graduating in 1984 from Pasadena’s Art Center College of Design, Méndez taught first at her alma mater and then in the Design Media Arts Department at UCLA where she is presently working.  In 1996 she also opened Rebeca Méndez Studio in partnership with her husband Adam Eeuwens.  She specializes in film and video installations for cultural programs and institutions, collaborations with architects on interior commissions, photography, book design, and public art commissions.  All of her creative activity embodies an important set of values, experimentation, collaboration, and creative integrity.  The natural world is a thread running through all of Méndez’s work.   She has traveled to such “extreme” environments as the Sahara desert, Patagonia, Iceland, Chili, and Finland, and the Arctic, studying how different cultures relate to and portray nature and documenting her research through photography.   Méndez was the recipient of the 2012 National Design Award in the field of graphic design.",,,10,"Mexican and American, b. 1962",,18049203,,,,,,Rebeca Méndez,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049203/,,,,,,

"Armand G. Winfield has been involved professionally in the plastics field for over five decades. He graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in 1941 and did graduate work at the University of New Mexico, the State University of Iowa and at Washington University in St.Louis, Missouri. He began his career in museum work in the late 1930's and in the mid-1940's was a principal in Winfield Fine Art in Jewelry, a New York City Company involved in research and manufacturing of acrylic embedments. He has since been affiliated with such plastics concerns as Seymour Wallas & Co. and The Ritepoint Company - both in St. Louis, Missouri. He was Research Director of the Hanley Plastics Division of the Wallace Pencil Company in Brentwood, Missouri (1955-1957). In 1957, he was appointed Plastics Consulting Engineer at DeBell & Richardson, Inc. of Hazardville, Connecticut where he remained through 1963. Since January, 1964, he founded his own company where he has been an indipendent Plastics Consultant. Mr. Winfield has been on the teaching faculties of many Universities, Colleges and Istitutes and he also been a guest lecturer at over 30 other universities in the Unites States and abroad. In 1968 Armand G. Winfield was recipient of an United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). On June 9, 1970 The Plastics Institute in London elected Winfield as a Fellow. In 1972 Armand G. Winfield Inc. was retained by C.A.R.E., Inc. to design, develop and produce a low cost prototype house for Bangladesh, primarily using jute as the building material with polyester  binders.  In the 1974 the Winfields were retained by the Metropolitan Opera in New York City to consult on their refurbishing of certain opera sets. In 1977, Armand G. Winfield was retained by UNIDO to field consult in India on New Fibres and Composites - and to demonstrate uses of these materials. In 1979, the Winfields completed the refurbishing of an amusement park on Long Island, New York. In early 1980, Armand Winfield was retained by the College of Santa Fe to produce and direct a Conference entitled ""Viable Energy and Living Alternatives for New Decade"".  In 1983, Winfield was invited to become a VITA (Volunteers in Technical Assistance) Volunteer and later that year was elected to the Plastic Pioneers Association. During the past several years, the Winfields have been involved with machine design, product and process development, hydroponic farming and water storage systems for developing countries , recycling of plastics and non-plastics trash and industrial scrap, the development of Affordable housing systems for the United States, working in the electronic field and with new composites - and lecturing and writing for publication. Armand G. Winfield is the author of over 340 published articles, chapters and books on plastics and related subjects, almost 90 of which are concerned with plastics in building and architecture. Articles by the Winfields have been published in many countries around the world in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Russian as well as in English. Armand G. Winfield is a member of many technical and scientific organizations around the world.",,,9,"American, 1919–2009",,18041403,,,,,,Armand G.

"Dieter Rams is among the world’s most influential and celebrated industrial designers of the late twentieth century. During forty years at the German appliance and eletronics manufacturer, Braun, he designed or oversaw the production of more than 500 products. Many of those products have become mid-century modern icons, including his ET calculator series. Rams studied architecture at the Werkkunstschule in Wiesbaden, Germany.  In 1955, he began working at Braun on architectural projects, but soon found himself in—and then the head of— product design, first producing the PA 1 slide projector.  By the late 1950s, The Museum of Modern Art was acquiring his products for their permanent collection.

Rams left Braun in 1995. During his tenure, he also designed furniture for British manufacturer Vitsoe, including the 606 Universal Shelving system, in production since 1960.  Calculators, coffemakers, audio-visual equipment—whatever the object—had to adhere to Rams’s “Ten Principles of Good Design.”  He wanted his products to be innovative, simple, user- and environmentally friendly, and pleasant to touch.  His work is represented in many museums worldwide.

"Marianne was born in Finland and went to the Central School of Industrial Design in Helsingfors. In 1930, she worked with her mother, Anna Wegelius, director at Hemflit-Kotiahkeruus. Invited by friend Eliel Saarinen to teach at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1937, she eventually became head of the Department of Weaving and Textile Design. During her 25 years at Cranbrook, she was commissioned a number of times by architects and designers, including Eero Saarinen. Marianne is best known for her use of synthetic fabrics that were especially desirable among major American companies, such as automotive corporations and airlines.
She collaborated with her husband, architect Olav Hammarstrom, designing interiors and textiles. Together they developed a new loom that could accommodate wider widths of fabric. 
Marianne had dozens of solo exhibitions throughout her life. She began donating her works in 1983 to museums around the world.",,,77,"Finnish, active USA, 1909–1998",,18041443,,,,,,Marianne Strengell,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18041443/,,,,,23424812,23424812

"He was born in Fuerth, Bavaria, Germany, came to this country in 1900 and in 1902 joined a brother, the late Dr. Max Wallerstein, in the establishment of the Wallerstein Laboratories, consultants to the brewing industry on fermentation and allied matters.  
He was educated in Brussels, Belgium, and at the Cooper Union in New York City.  Through the years he and his brother built the business until it encompassed the use of enzymes in many branches of manufacturing, including silk, confectionery, syrup, soft drink and other industries. 
In 1937 he became president of Wallerstein Company, Inc. after the death of his brother and chairman in 1957.  He was also director of many compaines, including the Metal and Thermit Corporation and was a trustee of Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx and a member of the Chemists, Centuyr and Harmonie Clubs.  He held more than fifty patents covering the use of enzymes in industry and was known particularly for his invention of a process for retaining the sparkle in bottled beer.
He had donated works of art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Cooper Union, the Brooklyn Museum and Brown University.  Mr. Wallerstein helped many young science students to get established and gave active aid to refugees from Nazi Germany.  He was also active in the work of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies.
Leo Wallerstein died on November 6, 1958.
Wife was Mrs. Dorothy Calman Wallerstein, a son, George Wallerstein, and two daughters, Mrs. Alice Silton and Mrs. Dorothy Elgar.

"Ogden Codman was a noted American architect and interior decorator. With his friend, the novelist Edith Wharton, he co-authored the influential volume ""The Decoration of Houses"" in 1897, which advocated a return to classicism and a rejection of the excesses of Gilded Age fashion. A friend of the Hewitt sisters, he was one of a number of their close associates who in 1900 assisted with the purchase a large group of drawings from the celebrated Piancastelli collection in Rome. Despite his advocacy of traditional, southern European classicism, his tastes and purchases were far reaching and, throughout his life he would donate articles from his own collection to Cooper Hewitt, including embroidered bedding from 17th-century Iran, Dutch drawings, and Italian furniture.",,,16,"American, 1863–1951",,18052731,,,,,,Ogden Codman,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18052731/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"One of the most important and innovative architects working today, Samuel Mockbee was among the architects featured in the museum’s National Design Triennial exhibition in 2000. He was also a National Design Award finalist in 2000 and a recipient of the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship “Genius Grant.” 

Mockbee works in two capacities. His private firm with Coleman Coker—Mockbee-Coker Architects, established in 1986 in Memphis, Tennessee—focuses on site-specific architecture that relates to the topography and the history of the locale. In addition to his private practice, Mockbee also runs an alternative practice, Rural Studio, in connection with his teaching architecture at Auburn University in Alabama. In 1993, Mockbee co-founded Rural Studio with Dennis K. Ruth, who was then head of the School of Architecture at Auburn. Rural Studio’s vision was to develop low-cost, innovative housing for people in a poor, rural community, while providing hands-on experience to university architecture students and encouraging a strong social conscience in architectural work.",,,2,"American, 1944 – 2001",,18052781,,,,,,Samuel Mockbee,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18052781/,,,,,23424977,23424977

These fabrics are typical of Albers work during her years as a student and teacher at the Bauhaus, as well as her later work in the United States where she and her husband, Josef Albers, emigrated in 1933 to teach at Black Mountain College (1933-49).

"Angelo Testa was one of the foremost American textile designers of the mid-20th century. Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Testa (1921–1984) was the first graduate of the Institute of Design in Chicago, the former ""New Bauhaus,"" under László Moholy Nagy, textile artist, Marli Ehrman, and architect, George Fred Keck.  While still a student, he devised a rational theory for printed textiles and wallpapers that challenged the Bauhaus's strictly functionalist emphasis on textured woven (as opposed to printed) fabrics.   He reasoned, ""The textile designer…must determine what the function of [the] fabric is and what justification he has for putting a design on it.  He needs to experiment with line, form, texture, and colour, …and refrain from complete coverage, destroying the natural beauty of the textile.  Texture should be emphasized where the decorative function of the fabric is minimized, and colour and form where the function is purely decorative.""  Two years after graduating from the Institute of Design, Testa set up his own firm Angelo Testa & Co. Yet he never actively promoted his design business, unlike his better-known contemporaries Ben Rose and Ruth Adler Schnee, which may explain why his name is not more familiar to the general public.

As a painter as well as a designer, Angelo Testa was familiar with the work of contemporary abstract artists.  Between 1942 and 1960, he introduced to textile design abstract and nonobjective patterns using combinations of thick and thin lines, solid and outlined forms, positive and negative spaces, and ""clean pure colors.""  Some designs were screenprinted by his own firm, Angelo Testa & Co., which he founded in 1947,  others were produced by Greef, Forster Textiles Mills, Knoll Associates, and Cohn-Hall-Marx, all for the up-scale market.  These and his mass-produced roller printed designs (1947), which appeared as illustrations in shelter magazines, contributed to the rise of abstract printed textiles in Europe, especially in England. Other clients included Herman Miller Furniture Company, and the textile manufacturer, F. Schumacher & Company.",,,17,"American, 1921–1984",,18046223,,,,,,Angelo Testa,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046223/,,,,,23424977,23424977

Throughout her career, she was commissioned by the Finnish cultural ministry to design curtains for public buildings, such as the theater and Finlandia Hall.

"Maria Mundal was born in Norway. She learned tapestry weaving from her mother, a common Norwegian practice that is passed down from mother to daughter. Mundal produced home goods along with the rest of the women of the family, such as bedding, warm clothing and rugs. However, what she valued most were tapestries, which she deemed things of beauty.  
She and her husband, artist Mons Breidvik, with his seven children, moved to the United States in 1927. Too busy with her family to produce any tapestries, she did not open a studio until after WWII. By then she had already divorced and was working in Brooklyn. 
Mundal’s tapestries recall folk legends, myths and poetry. She was also a poet and translated famous English poems into Norwegian and vice-versa.",,,7,1893?–1974,,18046233,,,,,,Maria Mundal,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046233/,,,,,,

"William H. Bradley's Chicago-based publication, The Chap-Book, was considered to be the American public’s introduction to art nouveau style and the British Arts and Crafts movement. He was especially influenced by Aubrey Beardsley’s sophisticated illustrations for The Yellow Book, a journal of art and literature first published in London in  April 1894. Like Beardsley, Bradley relied on breaking the compositional rectangle into a series of dominant and subdominant lines, filling in areas with flat expanses of one or two colors.

Bradley illustrated covers for Collier's Weekly (for which he served as art editor from 1907–10), Scribner’s Magazine, and Harper’s.",,,1,"American, 1868–1962",,18055599,,,,,,William Henry Bradley,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055599/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Edith Malvina Keteltas Wetmore was born in Geneva, Switzerland, on September 23, 1870. Her father, George Peabody Wetmore, was governor of Rhode Island from 1885 to 1887 and a United States Senator from 1895 through 1913. Miss Wetmore, who was educated in private schools in the United States and Europe, never married. She lived with her sister, Maude K. Wetmore, at the family estate. Maude Wetmore was nationally known Republican leader until her death in 1951. Edith Wetmore was a charter member and first president of the Old State House in Newport, Inc., founded to maintain the State Capitol which was more than 200 years old. She also helped found the Newport Casino Theater, in Newport, Rhode Island. She was a fellow in perpetuity of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. She was considered a leader in the social society that Newport, Rhode Island was known for.

Miss Wetmore's lavish estate, Chateau-sur-Mer, on Bellevue Avenue, Newport, Rhode Island, was the scene of many of Newport's most elaborate gatherings. Built by her father, it was one of the resort's two summer palaces still run in the old style with a butler and liveried footmen. The house is known as one of the best examples of the Aesthetic style interior.
Adapted from The New York Times obituary, 3/11/1966",Last of the old-guard of northeastern high-society,"Daughter of a Rhode Island governor and US Senator, Edith Wetmore was a benefactor of cultural institutions in both Newport and New York. She never married and, at her death in 1966, was considered by many to be the last of the old-guard of traditional high-society in the Northeast.",119,"American, b.

"Anna Hyatt became interested in animals at an early age, due to her father’s position at Harvard University and MIT, where he taught paleontology and zoology. She studied art at the Arts League of New York and did extensive studies from nature. Hyatt married Archer Milton Huntington, stepson to wealthy industrialist Collis P. Huntington. In 1932, Hyatt became the first female artist to be selected member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. 
As one of the most celebrated American sculptors of the 20th century, Hyatt was commissioned to create works all over the world. Her most celebrated statue is the Jean d’Arc equestrian on Riverside Dr. overlooking the Hudson River in New York City. She received several awards throughout her long life.

"Franz von Zülow was a designer and artist who created designs for prints, wallpaper, fabrics, decorative household objects, painted furniture, tapestries, paintings, drawings, picture books, and other graphic works. 

After studying at two Viennese drawing schools, the Allgemeine Zeichenschule (General Drawing School) and the Graphische Lehr-und Versuchsanstalt (the Graphic Academy and Research Institute) in Vienna from 1901–03, he broadened his studies at the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of Arts and Crafts) until 1906. In 1905, he decorated a screen designed by Josef Hoffmann with colored woodcuts of sunflowers, a design he also adapted for a fabric pattern. He joined the Vienna Secession in 1908, and exhibited at the International Art Exhibition in Rome in 1911. In 1912, he was the recipient of the Prince of Liechtenstein’s travel stipend and spent time in Germany, France, and England. That same year he designed rugs, textiles, decorative panel paintings, and stencil designs for the Wiener Werkstätte. From 1920 to 1922 he was an instructor at the ceramics study workshop in Gmunden, Austria. In 1925, he was awarded a Gold Medal at the Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Moderne for a vase produced by the Wiener Porzellanmanufaktur at Augarten.[1] Von Zülow continued to exhibit ceramics at numerous exhibitions in Vienna through the 1930s.

In 1907, early in his career, Von Zülow’s experiments with printing techniques led him to patent a method using a cut paper pattern to create a template that is colored and printed in reverse. In contrast to previous template printing, the resulting picture is not dependent upon the negative forms that have been cut out, but rather on the crosspieces that remain. These form a network of black outlines; the empty spaces between the crosspieces are often strongly colored, creating an almost cloisonné-like effect.

"Ludwig Hohlwein was the most innovative Munich-based graphic designer of his era. Hohlwein’s bold images, high-keyed colors, and decorative fonts on uniform grounds have impacted the graphic design work of everyone from A. M. Cassandre and Jean Carlu to Herbert Matter, Joseph Binder, and Paul Rand, to name a few. 

Hohlwein owes his aesthetic style to a major 1898 design exhibition held at Munich’s Glaspalast that showcased the French art nouveau graphics of Jules Chéret, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Alphonse Mucha, as well as the English Arts and Crafts design team known as The Beggarstaffs, comprised of James Pryde and William Nicholson. The Beggarstaffs pioneered the use of cut colored paper to create their designs, which juxtaposed flat forms and patterns with positive and negative shapes. A number of Beggarstaff poster maquettes were on exhibition in the Munich show. 

Hohlwein began his career as graphic designer in 1906, after studying architecture. Hohlwein combined flat forms with a rich range of texture and decorative patterning. Many of his early posters advertised clothing manufacturers and retail stores such as his poster and logo for his friend Hermann Scherrer’s clothing shop (1907) or his poster and Marque PKZ logo for the Swiss candy company Kehl (1908). Hohlwein is also well known for his propaganda posters during World War I and World War II.",,,1,1874–1949,,18058415,,,,,,Ludwig Hohlwein,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18058415/,,,,,23424829,23424829

"Originally founded in 1957 as Brownjohn, Chermayeff and Geismar, the ""Design Studio"" was strongly influenced by European Modern Art currents.  Characterized by a strong sense of form, their work exploits the vitality of repetition and texture. The firm distinguished itself in designs for album covers, graphic designs for books and plays and their inovative installation for the American Pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair in 1958.  In 1960, Robert Brownjohn (1925-1970) left the firm.

"Christ, as the artist prefers to be named, was born in Gabrovo,  Bulgaria in 1935. He studied at the Fine Arts Academy , Sofia, Bulgaria from 1952-56, the Burian Theater in Prague in 1956 and at the Fine Arts Academy in Viennia in 1957.  In 1960 he married Jeanne-Claude Guillebon with whom he collaborates on many of larger projects. 
In 1958 he began his first 'wrappings' often interpreted as a comentary on the packaging of experience in modern culture.  Ordinary objects are selected, sometimes randpomly, and wrapped in a variety of materials and secured with string, rope or tape.  In some cases, the wrapping changes the perception of the solidity, dimension and structure of the object.  
Christo is know for monumental projects undertaken in the late 1960s and continuing to the present. Among the best known are Wrapping the Reichstag Building in Berlin; The Valley Curtain Project, Colorado; and Running Fence, California.
Christo became a naturalized American citizen in 1973.",,,4,"American, b. Bulgaria 1935",,18053287,,,,,,Christo,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053287/,,,,,23424977,23424977
"Finnish-American architect and designer, Eero Saarinen, son of Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen and sculptor Loja Gesellius, is a major figure in modern design. He is best known for a number of American landmarks, including the highly sculptural TWA terminal building at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport (1956–62) and the soaring, stainless steel Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri (1963–65). Like several of his contemporaries, he also undertook furniture design, which presented unique technical and aesthetic challenges, particularly in the category of seating. Saarinen’s furniture designs of the 1940s and 50s were benchmarks for postwar innovations in form, function, material, and production techniques.",,,7,"American, born Finland, 1910 - 1961",,18053281,,,,,,Eero Saarinen,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053281/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Although less well known than her husband, architect and designer Alvar Aalto, Aino Marsio Aalto was a highly talented modern designer in her own right. She received her architecture degree in 1920 from what is now the Helsinki University of Technology, after which she worked for architect Oiva Kallio. In 1923, she joined Alvar Aalto’s practice and, in 1924, they married. In 1935, the Aaltos, together with art historian Nils-Gustav Hahl and the Finnish industrialists Harry and Maire Gullichsen, established the firm Artek to produce and distribute Aalto’s bentwood furniture. Aino Aalto was Managing Director of the firm from 1941 until her death in 1949. A versatile designer, she specialized in interior design but was also active in textiles and ceramics and showed a particular affinity for glass, whether working independently or collaborating with Aalto.

"One of the foremost French decorative painters of the late nineteenth century, Galland was born in Switzerland and first apprenticed with his father, the goldsmith Jacques Galland, before entering the Ecole des Beaux-Arts where he later became a professor of decorative painting. In the 1840s he joined the atelier of Henri Labrouste, where he worked alongside the cabinetmaker Leon Marcotte and architect Detlief Lenau.  He also served as director of the Gobelins Manufactory.  His decorative paintings can be found in the Pantheon and Hotel de Ville in Paris,  and at Elm Park (now the Lockwood-Mathews Mansion) in Connecticut, designed by his colleague Detlief Lenau with interior decoration and furnishings by the noted nineteenth century decorating firm, Herter Brothers, with whom he worked regularly on commissions in New York City and Newport from the 1870-1880s.",,,8,"Swiss, active France, 1822 - 1892",,18063295,,,,,,Pierre-Victor Galland,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18063295/,,,,,23424957,23424957

"Ben Seibel, born in Newark, New Jersey in 1918, grew up in Manhattan, where his mother started a shop in Greenwich Village selling her own jewelry and fashion designs. Seibel began pursuing a degree in architecture at Columbia University after studying painting under Louis Schanker and sculpture under Leo Amino. After putting his education on hold for a three-and-a-half year term of service in the Air Force, Seibel returned to New York City in 1945, enrolling at Pratt Institute with a concentration in industrial design. He never completed his degree, instead starting a studio that he maintained alongside a small staff until his death in 1985 at the age of 67. Seibel is best known for his tableware designs, drawing influences from his study of sculpture and travels in Japan. His work in ceramics was prolific and wide-ranging in style, reaching prominence in the 1950s with his Informal and Impromptu lines for Iroquois China.

"Pieter Brattinga, with Willem Sandberg and Wim Crouwel, ranks among the leading figures who helped re-establish Dutch prowess in graphic design in the postwar period—particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. Brattinga and others helped to forge the modern concepts of “functional total design,” which provided distinctive systems of unified visual identity programs for business firms, government agencies, and cultural institutions. 

Brattinga learned the printing business from his father’s printing firm, De Jong & Co., located in Brattinga’s birthplace of Hilversum, near Amsterdam.",,,15,"Dutch, 1931 - 2004",,18051011,,,,,,Pieter Brattinga,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051011/,,,,,23424909,23424909

Between 1965 and 1971, she worked with Father Paoli at the Abbey of Saint Michel de Cuxa and at ateliers of Lurçat and Picart Le Doux, in Perignan, France.  Viennet works in the tradition of Bernard Palissy, Renaissance ceramist, who created colorful trompe l’oeil objects.

"Fuchs studied textile design at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Basel and Zurich and worked in the textile field before becoming interested in jewelry.  Her jewelry has been exhibitied in many one-man shows at galleries and museums thaorughout Europe in the 1980s, including Gallery RA in Amsterdam, the Electrum gallery in London, and the Musee d'art et d'histoire in Geneva.  Her works are in the permanent collecitons of the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris, the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Frankfurt, Germany, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and many others magor European museums.
Beadwork is a special interst of Sieber-Fuchs, bridging textile and jewelry design as has her career.  In addtion to traditional glass beads, she has also incorporated such unconventional meterials as tiny bits of unexposed photographic film and chopped up newpaper financila pages into her jewelry designs.  Working in Zurich, a center of pharmaceutical manufacturing, perhaps it is not suprising the Sieber-Fuch should turn to pill packaging for its possibilities in texture and ornament.",,,1,"Swiss, b. 1943",,18051009,,,,,,Verena Sieber-Fuchs,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051009/,,,,,23424957,23424957

"Industrial designer, architect, graphic designer, illustrator, writer and entrepreneur, Walter Dorwin Teague is noted as one of the founders of the industrial design profession in the United States.  He is also considered an influential figure among the pioneering designers who introduced modernism to America through product and exhibition design as well as writings. Teague was born and raised in Indiana.  Influenced by architecture books he read in high school, he decided to become an artist. At the age of nineteen Teague moved to New York, where he studied at the Art Students League and eventually went into commercial illustration, and later, advertising, graphic and package design. After traveling to Europe in 1926, and observing stylistic movements and developments in design there, he returned to New York where he opened his own design consultancy, Walter Dorwin Teague Associates. Utilizing his years of experience and thorough knowledge of marketing and diverse design disciplines, Teague and his firm served a variety of corporate clients, designing cameras for Eastman Kodak, glass for Steuben, radios for Spartan, and a corporate identity program for the oil company, Texaco, among others. Teague’s design legacy and firm, now known simply as Teague and based in Seattle, Washington, continue to this day.",,,12,"American, 1883–1960",,18053975,,,,,,Walter Dorwin Teague,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053975/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was born on November 24, 1864 in southern France.
Son and heir of Comte Alphonse-Charles de Toulouse, he was the last in the line of an aristocratic family that dated back a thousand years. Today, the family estate
houses the Musée Toulouse-Lautrec. At age twelve Toulouse-Lautrec broke his left leg and at fourteen his right leg. The bones did not heal properly, and his legs ceased to grow. He reached maturity with a body trunk of normal size but with abnormally short legs. He was only 4 1/2 feet (1.5 meters) tall.
Deprived of the physical life that a normal body would have permitted, Toulouse-Lautrec lived completely for his art. He dwelt in the Montmartre section of Paris, the center of the
cabaret entertainment and bohemian life that he loved to depict in his work. Dance halls and nightclubs, racetracks, prostitutes- all these were memorialized on canvas or made into
lithographs. 
In order to join in the Montmartre life - as well as to fortify himself against the crowd's ridicule of his appearance -Toulouse-Lautrec began to drink heavily. By the 1890s the
drinking was affecting his health. He was confined first to a sanatorium and then to his mother's care at home, but he could not stay away from alcohol. Toulouse-Lautrec died on
September 9, 1901, at the family chateau of Malrome.",,,8,1864 – 1901,,18053903,,,,,,Henri Marie Raymo Toulouse-Lautrec,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053903/,,,,,,

"Primarily known as a sculptor, Harry Bertoia came to the United States in 1930. From 1939–43, he studied and taught metalwork and jewelry at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan, where he met Cranbrook alumni, including Charles and Ray Eames and Florence Knoll (née Schust). By 1950, Bertoia was based in California, where he created art and sometimes worked with Charles Eames. 

In 1950, Florence and Hans Knoll, interested in developing new furniture lines, invited Bertoia to move east and work for Knoll Associates with an unconventional arrangement: they would provide a salary and a studio near the Knoll factory in Pennsylvania, but would not make specific demands on Bertoia’s time or creativity. The Knolls allowed Bertoia the freedom to create metal sculpture and work in wire by hand, using simple tools. Within two years, he conceived a series of side chairs and lounge chairs for mass production made of wire mesh formed into seating shells. Among the series is the Diamond chair, which was introduced in 1952 and has since become an iconic modern design.",,,3,"American, born Italy, 1915 - 1978",,18053901,,,,,,Harry Bertoia,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053901/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Henning Koppel was perhaps the most eminent artist attached to the Georg Jensen firm in the period following World War II. Koppel trained as a sculptor and designer at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen and at the Académie Ranson in Paris, and began working for the Jensen firm in 1945. Breaking from Jensen tradition, Koppel’s silverwork was distinguished by his interest in modernism, made evident in his particular use of abstract and sculptural forms. 

Koppel is a pivotal design figure, whose drawings and works are represented in major museum collections throughout the world. He won innumerable awards, including gold medals at the Milan Triennale in 1951, 1954, and 1957, and the ID Prize of the Society of International Design in 1966.",,,4,"Danish, 1918 – 1981",,18053917,,,,,,Henning Koppel,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053917/,,,,,23424796,23424796

In over 42 years of practice, the versatile Pesce has undertaken a range of commissions from architecture to urban planning, interior design, industrial design, lighting, furniture, and publising. As one of the most unconventional and multi-talented designers of the 20th century, he has become known for his explorations of, and innovative approaches to, materials and production processes. He is particularly well know for his work in resin. Pesce has resided in New York since 1980, and taught at several institutions including Cooper Union in New York, and the Institut d'Architecture et d'Etudes Urbaines in Strasbourg. His work has won numerous awards, and is included in the peramanent collections of many museums such as Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

"Irena Brynner was one of America's distinguished studio jewelers. Developing her personal style within a context of international art jewelry in the post-World War II era, Brynner played a significant role in American jewelry design.
In 1931, Brynner’s Swiss-Russian father moved with his wife and daughter to Dairen, Manchuria, where he set up a prosperous business with his brothers. He was instrumental in 1940 in providing the safe evacuation of the personnel of both the American and British consular offices and also f the Maryknoll Missionaries. Irena attended high school in Harbin, Manchuria, and later the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. She moved to the United States in 1946, and continued her sculpture studies in San Francisco. She has lived and worked in New York since 1957.
In 1950, Brynner began to experiment in jewelry. With a background in both painting and academic sculpture, Brynner saw jewelry as an opportunity to make “wearable sculpture,” an approach that has continued to guide and inspire her work for more than four decades. In her work, Brynner exploited sculptural techniques, such as casting, soldering, and hammering of the metal. Frequently, her work features unique or surprising combinations of mineral specimens, specially cut or polished semi-precious stones, and found objects, such as tree bark or fragments of ethnographic artefact. Her works are also highlighted by unusual treatments of clasps and closures, and she developed her own unique type of earrings with sinuous shapes that caress and embrace the shape of the ear itself. The artist viewed her work as a logical extension of her early interest in sculpture: “I did not compromise my work when I stopped doing large sculpture; my jewelry is sculpture that relates to the human body.”
Brynner’s early work was sold through the Georg Jensen shop in New York. In 1958, she opened a small jewelry boutique on 55th Street. That year, Brynner also exhibited at the Brussels World’s Fair and, in 1959, was given a one-person show at the Museum of Contemporary Craft. In 1967, she published “Modern Jewelry—Design and Techniques,” followed in 1979 by “Jewelry as an Art Form.” These volumes revealed many of the special techniques developed by Brynner over the years. 
Brynner’s work often focused on the transformation of one object—cut or uncut stones and minerals, ancient beads, or fragmentary objects—into another new form, which emphasized and enhanced the evocative or mystical quality of the material held in space by organic and sensuous metal settings. The artist said about her own work: “I live surrounded by metamorphoses. I am not even responsible for everything I do in my art; when I touch things that might be used in my",,,13,"American, b.

"Eugene Grasset (Lausanne, Switzerland May 25, 1841-October 23, 1917 Sceaux, France)
Born in Lausanne in 1841, to a cabinet designer/maker and sculptor, Grasset studied drawing under Francois-Louis David Bocion (1828-90), a student of Charles Gleyre. In 1861, Grasset went to Zurich to study architecture and later sculpture.  Between 1865 and 1867, he traveled to Marseille and then to Egypt.  These journeys would deeply influence his poster design later in life. Upon his return to Lausanne, he worked as a designer of decorative sculpture. In 1877, after six years in Paris, he began his early work as an illustrator, working with popular stories including “Le Petit Nab” (1877) and ""Histoire de quatre fils Aymon"" (1883).  As his career blossomed, Grasset designed furniture, posters, jewelry, and carpets, among many other forms of applied art, as well as architectural design.  His postage stamps for both France and Switzerland in 1877 gained him great popularity in those countries. Soon after, he focused in earnest on poster design. He was one of ninety-seven artists who contributed to Jules Cheret’s Maîtres de l’Affiche, the hugely popular Belle Époque book of posters.

In the 1880s, Grasset’s popularity had reached the United States, where several American companies commissioned him to produced posters and later, the cover for the 1892 Christmas issue of Harper’s Magazine.  The immense popularity of France’s Art Nouveau style reached the United States in part, through Grasset’s connection to Louis Comfort Tiffany, who used his designs as inspiration for stained glass windows. 

Grasset taught at various art schools in Paris, and also exhibited his works at different venues, such as the Salon des Cent (1894) and Salon des Artistes Décorateurs (1904). The most notable exhibition of his work, however, was when the type foundry, G. Peignot et fils introduced the “Grasset” roman and italic typeface at the 1900 Universal Exposition. There he was also represented by tapestry, ceramics, and jewelry. That same year, Grasset published his influential two-volume book, La Plante et ses applications ornementales (1897-1900).",,,14,"Swiss, 1841 – 1917; active Paris, France 1871–1917",,18042605,,,,,,Eugène Samuel Grasset,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042605/,,,,,23424957,23424957

"Bernard Rudofsky was a writer, architect, curator and critic best known for his provocative exhibitions and books, including Are Clothes Modern? (MoMA NY 1944), a critique of the western fashion system; Architecture Without Architects (MoMA 1964), a celebration of vernacular architecture; and Now I Lay Me Down to Eat (Cooper Hewitt Museum, 1980), which presented multi-cultural alternatives to the basic design problems of living-- dining, sleeping, sitting, cleaning, and bathing. 
Born in Moravia, Rudofsky earned a doctorate in architecture, then went on to work in Germany, Italy and Brazil before settling in New York in 1941. He continued to travel extensively throughout his life. He taught at Yale, MIT, Waseda University in Tokyo, and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, and was a Guggenheim, Ford, and Fulbright Fellow. 
Rudofsky's travels were a type of field research in his ongoing critique of the limited scope of Western architecture and design. His body of work, while humorous and subversive, presents a sustained argument for a human-centered design.",,,1,"American, b.

"Bush-Brown grew up on the Hudson, near Newburg, NY, and studied art at the Pratt Institute. She is best known for her tapestries, which were extremely popular during her lifetime.  She would combine stenciling, block-printing and embroidery on brightly colored silks, creating lovely mural silks, as she called them. Although she employed the batik technique of wax resist dyeing, she did not see her work as having traditional qualities. Her works were exhibited all over the United States, including the Pan-American Exhibition, the Ehrich Gallery, the Architectural League, the National Arts Club, and other venues. Bush-Brown’s process was to observe nature and then sketch her ideas, which were then transferred to the fabric with wax. She was inspired by her international travels, which included Mexico, Europe, and the Near East.",,,26,"American, 1887–1984",,18045909,,,,,,Lydia Bush-Brown,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045909/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Finnish fabric manufacturer and retail chain. The company's chief designer was Armi Ratia (1912-1979), who was known for her use of vibrant colors and large patterns. She first joined her husband's design firm, Printex, in 1949. In 1951, the company was renamed Marimekko, which means ""a little dress for Mary"" in Finnish. During the 1960s and '70s, the firm manufactured cotton, jersey, and wool fabrications, along with paper, laminated plastics, and table coverings. Ratia was known for designing free, easy fashions in bold painterly designs taking much of her inspiration from nature and handicraft. Ben Thompson, the founder of the retail establishment Design Research, Inc. (D/R), discovered Ratia's designs at the Finnish Pavilion of the Brussels Worlds Fair in 1957, and persuaded her to come to the United States. D/R became the exclusive representative of Marimekko products in women and children, as well as household accessories and furniture.",,,18,1951 – 1979,,18048723,,,,,,"Marimekko, Inc.",,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18048723/,,,,,23424812,23424812

"Graphic and product design, film/video. M & Co. was a graphic and product design consultancy that was founded in 1979 in New York City by Tibor Kalman. Kalman (b.1949), a native of Budapest, immigrated to America with his family in the late 1950s. While in New York, Kalman studied journalism at New York University. His interest in language, words, images, and typography, became the impetus for the creation of his own design firm. M & Co. was known for its innovative use of images and type to create imaginative and witty designs. Many prominent figures in the field got their start with M & Co., including Stephen Doyle, Alexander Isley, Bethany Johns, Marlene McCarty, and Emily Oberman. During its 14-years history, the company worked on a variety of projects from videos and album covers to stationery and ID systems. Clients included Hannibal Records, the Talking Heads, the Memphis real-estate agency, the Restaurant Florent and the China Grill in New York, the National Audubon Society, Benetton, Swatch, and NYNEX. M & Co. created the title sequences for movies including Jonathan Demme's ""Something Wild"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", and David Byrne's ""True Stories"". In addition, M & Co., created its own line of products, among them an architectural paperweight made of rigid vinyl and lead, mimicking a crumpled piece of blueprint paper, and a line of timepieces with nontraditional faces. Among their better known timepieces are the ""10-1-4"" watch, whose face has only the numbers 10, 1, and 4, in their appropriate places; the ""Onomatopoeia"" watch, where certain digits are replaced by symbols, such as a  hand representing the number five; the ""Bug"" watch, where numerals were replaced with a variety of insect symbols; and the ""Askew"" watch, whose digits appeared on the face in random order. Kalman identifies his wife Maira, herself a noted artist and children's author, as ""an important collaborator"". Kalman dissolved the company in 1992. At that time he donated the company's administrative and project files to the museum. Kalman moved to Rome in 1993 to edit Benetton'magazine, ""Colors"". Subsequently, he returned to New York to work independently.",,,335,founded 1979,,18048717,,,,,,M & Co.,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18048717/,,,,,23424977,23424977

While there, she studied textile design and hand-looming, and then joined the Wiener Werkstatte. In 1934, she went to the United States and began working for Dunhill. Her wools were used by fashion and costume designers, like Lentz Gibbons, a company that exclusively used her fabrics for suits, capes, and coats.

"Peter Müller-Munk (1904-1967) trained as a silversmith in Berlin, Germany, focused on crafting each piece by hand. It wasn’t until after he immigrated to New York City in 1926 that the German-born designer switched his focus to industrial design for mass production, creating the Art Deco tableware designs he is best-known for today.
 
Müller-Munk began his career in the United States by working as a silver designer at Tiffany & Co. and exhibiting his luxury metalwork at the 1928 Macy’s Exposition. By 1929, he had established his own silver studio and exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In response to the rapid decline in demand for expensive silverwares during the Great Depression, Müller-Munk transferred his focus to industrial design, creating sleek, consumer-oriented domestic objects.
 
Müller-Munk went on to become a major force in legitimizing the design profession and establishing design education. He served as head of the first American degree program in industrial design at the Carnegie Institute of Technology during the 1930s while completing design projects for companies like Westinghouse, Dow Chemicals, Texaco and U.S. Steel. Müller-Munk also left a definitive mark on the national and international evolutions of post-war industrial design by serving as president of the Society of Industrial Designers in 1954 and president of the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design in 1957. The award-winning and prosperous design consultancy firm he founded in 1944, Peter Müller-Munk Associates, went on to work in communication and environmental design after his death.

"Renowned for his statement that “good design is good business,” Eliot Noyes was an architect and industrial designer responsible for establishing a number of modern design philosophies and practices that reign as standards today. He is particularly noted for creating corporate design programs at IBM, Westinghouse, Mobil Oil and Cummins Engines in the 1950s and 60s.

Noyes was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1910. He graduated from Harvard University’s newly established Graduate School of Design in 1938, influenced by famed Bauhaus designers and Harvard instructors Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. After working briefly for Gropius and Breuer and traveling across the country to study modern design, Noyes became the first director of The Museum of Modern Art’s Industrial Design Department in 1940. During his tenure, Noyes projected designers like Charles and Ray Eames and Eero Saarinen into the spotlight via the museum’s “Organic Design in Home Furnishing” competition. He worked with such manufacturers as Knoll and Herman Miller to configure the new processes necessary for producing their designs, thus contributing significantly to the mass production of modern furniture.

After leaving MoMA in 1946, Noyes entered the corporate design realm to work as design director in industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes’ firm. While there, Noyes was entrusted with the design of IBM’s Model A electric typewriter. When Bel Geddes’ business folded in 1947, Noyes maintained the commission and completed the design. This led Noyes to start his own design firm in 1947 for which he took on commissions from major companies, including the logo and look of all Mobil gas stations. One of Noyes’ most acclaimed designs is his own home in New Canaan, Connecticut, where, as one of a group of architects known as the Harvard Five, he helped turn an average town into a hub for modernist architecture.

"Revere Copper and Brass, Inc. was originally started by Paul Revere in 1801 as he worked to reduce the young United States’ dependence on England for rolled copper sheets, which were important for sheathing the hulls of ships. After intensive trial and error and research on copper rolling techniques, Revere became the first American to roll copper successfully. Copper rolled at his mill was used to protect the hull of “Old Ironsides” and cover the dome of the Massachusetts State House. Mergers in 1928 and 1929 led Revere’s original copper mill, Revere Copper, in Canton, Massachusetts to be renamed Revere Copper and Brass, Inc. and relocated to Rome, New York. In 1938, an employee of the Revere Cooper and Brass, Inc. named James M. Kennedy invented copper-clad cookware, now called Revere Ware. The company continues to do business today, having returned to the name Revere Copper.

"Emerson Radio Corp. was incorporated in 1915 by Victor Hugo Emerson. Though based in New York City, the company's first factories were opened in Chicago and Boston, in 1920. The company expanded in the 20's and was thus renamed the Emerson Radio and Phonograph Corp. Although Emerson introduced the first radio-phonograph combination sold in the United States, the company remained in obscurity until 1932, when, during the Great Depression, it introduced the ""peewee"" radio. The company would later be one of the first to successfully market consumer televisions. 

The Emerson Radio and Phonograph Corp. is particularly notable as the manufacturer of the red, white and blue ""Patriot"" radio, designed by Norman Bel Geddes.",,,1,,,18064533,,,,,,Emerson Radio and Phonograph Corp.,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18064533/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Industrial designer Walter Von Nessen founded Nessen Studios in Manhattan’s Murray Hill neighborhood upon immigrating to the United States from Germany in 1927. Von Nessen utilized the studio to produce lighting for the most part, but also created tableware, furniture and appliance designs. When Von Nessen died in 1943, his wife Greta briefly closed the firm. She reopened Nessen Studios after WWII and resumed the production of lamps, adding lighting designs of her own to its oeuvre. Nessen Studios is still in business today under the name Nessen Lighting, Inc. It is now located in Mamaroneck, New York.

"Henning Watterston was one of the most successful weaver/designers of the postwar period. He studied painting and textile design at the Rudolph Schaeffer School of Design in San Francisco. In 1941 he and his wife, Carolyn Rees, joined Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin Fellowship, where they designed and wove curtains for Wright’s Rose Pauson House in Phoenix, Arizona. Through the 1940s, Watterston became well-known for his textural casements designed for Menlo Textiles. In 1949, he moved his studio to New York.

"American designer, Lester Beall (1903-1969), was educated at Lane Technical School in Chicago and received a bachelor's degree in art history from the University of Chicago. 
Upon discovering the work of the European avant-garde, Beall was inspired to bring American design of the 1930s and 1940s to a higher level of effective visual communication. Self-taught, Lester Beall was one of the first Americans to have his work shown in a German monthly graphics periodical, ""Gebrauchsgraphik"", and was one of the first Americans to incorporate the New Typography, using techniques such as the photomontage, collage and the use of cut-out flat colored paper in combination with photography and economical line drawing, reworking the element of European modernism into a distinctive American style. He produced solutions to graphic design problems that were unique among his American contemporaries.
Beall moved from Chicago to New York City in 1935 and did much work that was influential to the field of editorial design. In 1937 Beall became the first American commercial artist to be honored with one-man show at The Museum of Modern Art, New York. Between 1938 and 1940, Beall redesigned twenty magazines for McGraw Hill, in 1946 he designed two covers for ""Fortune"" and in 1944 he began designing ""Scope"" magazine for Upjohn Pharmaceuticals which he did until 1951. In 1952, Beall opened a design office in Dumbarton farm, his home in rural Connecticut. In 1973, four years after his death, Lester Beall was inducted into the New York Art Directors Club Hall of Fame.
Philip B. Meggs credits Beall with ""almost single-handedly launching the modern movement in American design"". In 1973, the Art Directors Club of New York belatedly elected him to its prestigious Hall of Fame. Bob Plisken, who worked for Beall in the early 1940s, said on that occasion, ""In my opinion, Beall did more than anyone to make graphic design in America a distinct and respected profession"".",,,10,"American, 1903–1969",,18048993,,,,,,Lester Beall,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18048993/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Trude Guermonprez started weaving in Halle, Germany at the Municipal School of Arts and Crafts. Her family emigrated to the United States in 1939. After war, Trude did freelance work in Holland, where her husband, photographer Paul Guermonprez, was killed while serving in the Dutch Underground. Six years of weaving in a Dutch rug shop preceded her coming to America, at the invitation of Anni Albers, to teach at Black Mountain College, and later to northern California to join her friend, Marguerite Wildenhain, at Pond Farm Workshops in a producing-teaching cooperative in Guerneville.Then, she moved to San Francisco with her new husband, the craftsman-builder John Elsesser, and worked there becoming Chairman of the Craft Department at The California College of Arts and Crafts. In Studio One at the Oakland College she helped young people approach her artistry.Though she has designed fabrics for New York textile manufacturers, her works were mainly custom produced for architects and individuals.

"One of Japan's leading graphic designers and art directors since the 1960s, Nagai trained at theTokyo National University of Fine Arts in scultpure but left in 1951 to work as a graphic designer for the Tokyo Spinning Co. in Osaka.  Starting in 1960, he worked for the Nippon Design Center, serving as its president and later as director.  By the early 1960s, he had developed a personal style of abstract, geometric, linear forms and patterns that create surreal landscapes. This style appeared in posters for Nikon; GQ magazine; and his freelance work of the 1970s and early 1980s.  By the late 1980s realistic elements entered his design vocabularly.  There have been several retrospective exhibitions of his work, the most recent at the Tokyo, National Museum of Modern Art in 1990.",,,5,"Japanese, b. 1929",,18053407,,,,,,Kazumasa Nagai,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053407/,,,,,23424856,23424856

"Mark Pollack studied weaving at the Rhode Island School of Design, and still continues to study the RISD collection of historic textiles to create unexpected interpretations. After graduating in 1976, he served eleven years as the associate design director of Jack Lenor Larsen Inc., before founding his own company, The Pollack Studios, eighteen years ago. Pollack is well known for his sophisticated, meticulously crafted fabrics. He is a relentless experimenter who truly respects the technology and craft of textiles. The inspiration for his fabrics comes from the material and construction of the fabric itself as well as the process of creating the fabric. Having started in contract textiles before developing lines for residential interiors, his textiles combine rigorous material engineering with a highly developed aesthetic.

"WMF - Württembergische Metallwarenfabrik  was originally founded in 1853 in Geislingen an der Steige, as a metalworking shop, but in 1880 it merged with another company and took the name Württembergische Metallwarenfabrik or Metalware Factory of Württemberg. Thereafter it actively acquired other companies, including a Polish metalwork company, and then the Kunstanstalt für Galvanoplastik München, which specialized in electrotyping and electroforming. In 1900, WMF acquired an Austrian metalwork company, Albert Köhler's AK & CIE, which produced and distributed WMF items under their mark to the Austria-Hungarian market until about 1914, accounting for some of the Wiener Werkstätte influences on the firm’s production.

By the early1900’s, WMF was the world's largest producer and exporter of domestic metalware, much of which was in the Jugendstil, or Art Nouveau style, but other examples showed the craft movement influence of the Wiener Werkstätte too. The firm's best known period occured during the directorship of Albert Mayer, a sculptor and designer, from 1884 to 1914. The firm acquired numerous other holdings, and continues to this day. It was acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2012.",,,10,1853-Present,,18055821,,,,,,Württembergische Metallwarenfabrik (WMF),,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055821/,,,,,23424829,23424829

"Claudy Jongstra (Dutch, b. 1963)  is a contemporary textile designer who practices the ancient technique of felting. She studied fashion design at the Academy of Art in Utrecht, and established her own design studio, “Nót Tom Dick & Harry,” after graduating in 1989. In 1994, after seeing an exhibition on felt at the Textile Museum in Tilburg, she became fascinated with its fabrication process, and has worked exclusively in felt ever since. She is best-known for her Drenth Heath felts, which are characterized by their raw, primitive quality, with long locks of curly fleece still intact.  Since the mid-1990s she has created extraordinary felted fabrics for fashion designers such as John Galliano, Christian Lacroix, and Donna Karan, and architects and designers Steven Holl, Will Bruder, Jasper Morrison, and Marcel Wanders. Jongstra’s fabrics have a raw elegance that comes from her use of materials such as wild silk, wild linen, and wild cashmere, as well as the special (and proprietary) techniques she has developed in her felting.  Jongstra even goes so far as to raise her own sheep in the Dutch countryside and currently has a herd of 200 including the rare species of long-haired Drenthe Heath, whose shorn locks she felts along with the straw and lanolin that accumulates on their hair.",,,2,"Dutch, b. 1963",,18057439,,,,,,Claudy Jongstra,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18057439/,,,,,23424909,23424909

"One of the most influential graduates of the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany, Hungarian-born Marcel Breuer was a protégé of Bauhaus director, architect Walter Gropius. After graduating in 1924, Breuer was invited back to become master of the carpentry workshop at the new Bauhaus quarters in Dessau. From 1925-28, aside from his teaching duties, he created a series of innovative modernist tubular steel furniture designs recognized for their light, sturdy and rational construction and manufacture. His later designs for aluminum furniture won first prize at the 1934 Paris international competition for the best aluminum chair. Uncertain of continuing work in Europe, Breuer moved to England in 1935 to form a partnership with English architect F.S.R. Yorke. To supplement his practice, Breuer also started to design plywood furniture for the new Isokon Furniture Company.  Breuer’s mentor Gropius, who moved to England in 1934, was also a part of the venture, and from its beginning he wanted Breuer to create designs for the firm given his previous experience creating innovative furniture. In 1937, Breuer settled in the United States and joined the faculty of Harvard University School of Design, again under the leadership of  Walter Gropius, who left England the year before. During the next 40 years in America, Breuer combined a modernist style with local materials, designing furniture for his own interiors and continuing to experiment with plywood.

"Hitoshi Ujiie, was born in Kyoto, Japan, and worked in his family's textile business, is a textile designer as well as educator and founder of the Center for Excellence in Digital Inkjet Printing at Philadelphia University. He received a B.F.A from Kyoto Seika University in Japan and a M.F.A from the University of Georgia. Ujiie’s work is an exploration of the aesthetic implications of digital inkjet printing for textiles, which is bringing about profound changes in the approach to design for this medium. 
Working from photographic and video sources combined with hand manipulation, Ujiie exploits the full range of effects that can be achieved by digital technology, yet his work maintains a profoundly delicate aesthetic. Digital technology permits a fineness of line not previously possible due to the higher “resolution” of inkjet vs. screen technology. It also eliminates the need for repeat in textile design, and Ujiie turns his attention instead to a sense of movement without repetition.",,,4,"American, b.

"In 1877, at the age of 26, Doat joined the National Manufactory of Sevres.  His speciality was pate-sur-pate decoration and flambe, crystalline and metallic glazes. Doat also wrote the ceramic textbook, Grand Feu Ceramics, that was translated into English by Samuel Robineau.  In 1909, he arrived in the U.S. to work as the Director of the School of Ceramic Art at the Art Institute and the University City Pottery in Missouri.  Under his guidance, University City Pottery  flourished.  University City Pottery work was exhibited at the International Exposition of 1911 in Turin, Italy where it was awarded the Grand Prize in competition with all the European potteries.  After a reorganization of  University City Pottery in 1912, Doat stayed on as director.  Production at University City Pottery ended by early 1915.  Doat returned to France in 1915 and died there in May 1938.

"Established by Elbert Hubbard (1856 - 1915) in 1895, the Roycroft community was located in East Aurora, New York.  An Arts and Crafts community centered around a series of workshops, it employed up to 500 people at its peak. The workshops produced furniture, bookbindings and metalwork. Hubbard was ""an apostle of aestheticism"" and authored books on the relationshiop between the arts and life. Karl Kipp was selected by Hubbard to organize and direct the Roycroft copper shop, and by 1910 the workshop was in full production.  Kipp was assisted in this endeavor by Walter Jennings.  
In 1911, they left to start their own firm, The Tookay Shop, but in 1915 were persuaded to return by Elbert Hubbard II, who had succeeded his father after the death of his parents in the Lusitania disaster in 1915.  The wares were originally sold through gift shops and mail order, but Hubbard II decided to establish retail displays in major department stores.  By 1924, there were more than 320 retail outlets nationwide.  The firm's sales were drastically cut due to the Depression, and the Roycroft Shops formally declared bankruptcy in 1938.  Some of the early designs from the shop use motifs which were reminiscent of Viennese Secessionist designs, especially the work of Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser for the Wiener Werkstätte.  These designs were familiar to Dard Hunter, who had travelled to Vienna in 1908, and began incorporating Secessionist designs into his stained glass designs upon his return to the Roycroft community in 1909.  Karl Kipp and Dard Hunter collaborated on some lamps for the 1910 catalog and Hunter's designs probably influenced Kipp's work.",,,2,"East Aurora, NY, 1895 – 1938",,18055919,,,,,,Roycroft Shops,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055919/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Born in Paris and woked in Rome from about 1845 to 1898.  He was most well-known for his jewelry in the Etruscan style.  
""Pierret is first recorded as a working jeweller, of 55 via Borgogna, though no initial is given, in Murray's Handbook for Central Italy and Rome of 1850.  By the  1853 edition, his address, still with no initial, is given as 31 Piazza di Firenze, with the comment the he is 'now one of the first artists in Rome for Etruscan jewellery, and is more moderate in his charges than Castellani'.  The Libro Per Turri, an artistic and commercial guide to Rome of 1866, records Ernesto Pierret at 36 via dell' Umilta, but the Murray Handbook to Rome of 1867 records Pierret at 20 Piazza di Spagna and describes him as 'only second to Castellani'.  He remained at this address until the late 1890s when he no longer appears in the guidebooks or directories.  At some point prior to 1884, however, the business appears to have been taken over by Luigi Pierret, presumable a son, who exhibited 'archaeological-style' jewellry at the Turin Exhibition of 1884.""

"Lucian Bernhard was the most innovative Berlin-based designer of his era. Bernhard’s importance to the history of graphic design cannot be overestimated.

Bernhard owes his aesthetic style to a major 1898 design exhibition held at Munich’s Glaspalast that showcased the French art nouveau graphics of Jules Chéret, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Alphonse Mucha, as well as the English Arts and Crafts design team known as The Beggarstaffs, comprised of James Pryde and William Nicholson. The Beggarstaffs pioneered the use of cut colored paper to create their designs, which juxtaposed flat forms and patterns with positive and negative shapes. A number of Beggarstaff poster maquettes were on exhibition in the Munich show. Bernhard returned from this exhibition “drunk with color” and repainted his parents’ traditional apartment in brilliant hues. After a terrible dispute with his father, Bernhard settled in Berlin where he submitted a design to a poster competition sponsored by the Priester Match Company. Bernhard’s winning Priester poster (1905) is considered an icon of modernist graphic design. The poster launched Bernhard’s career and is considered a watershed moment in the history of graphic design. At the age of 23, Bernhard opened his own studio with 30 employees. In 1920, he was made the first professor of graphic design at the Berlin School of Arts and Crafts.

Before leaving Germany to settle in the United States in 1922, Bernhard created hundreds of similarly designed posters for major German firms, including Adler Typewriter, Stiller Shoes, and Bosch. He also made significant contributions in the field of typography, designing an entire family of typefaces from 1912 through the 1930s. During the late 1920s, Bernhard, with Rockwell Kent, Erich Mendelsohn, Bruno Paul, and Paul Poiret, founded the first international design consortium, known as Contempora, which produced textiles, decorative arts accessories, and furniture.",,,1,"German, 1883–1972",,18057961,,,,,,Lucian Bernhard,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18057961/,,,,,23424829,23424829

"Noted American architect, E. Fay Jones, was a pupil of Frank Lloyd Wright. Jones is primarily known as the creator of the Ozark style of architecture, although his buildings are located throughout the United States. His designs for houses, chapels, and churches are hailed as organic and site-sensitive. Influenced by his training under Wright, the designs often rely on cedar siding, shingles, and stone. Jones is probably best known for the Thorncrown Chapel (built 1980) in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. In 2000, the tall, light, tensile structure of glass, wood, and stone was voted the fourth-best building of the 20th century by the American Institute of Architects. In 1980, Jones won a Rome Prize Fellowship and, in 1990, he received the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal. Although his work shows an affinity for Wright’s approach and designs, Jones’s designs have a character of their own. They manifest his passion for the history of architecture, his engineering background, his eye for pragmatic detail, and his concern for needs of the client.

"George Landers was a hardware manufacturer who began operation in 1842 in Meriden, Connecticut. Together with Josiah Dewey, Landers produced furniture casting and hat-and-coat hooks. Levi O. Smith joined the firm and after Dewey’s death the company became Landers & Smith in 1853. In 1862, the company acquired the firm of Frary, Clark & Company of Meriden Connecticut. This addition of James Frary, an inventor and maker of scales and cutlery, and Clark, an attorney, would change the business’s direction. In 1865 the firm reorganized and incorporated, taking the name Landers, Frary & Clark, which it retained for nearly the full century of its existence. In 1866, the firm constructed a new building and began to make table cutlery and by 1903, LFC was the leading cutlery firm in the world. In the 1890s the trade name “Universal” was adopted for the company’s growing category of household products. The Universal breadmaker won a gold medal at the 1904 World’s Fair. LFC was one of the first companies to manufacture electric home appliances with the introduction of an electric coffee percolator in 1908 and an electric iron in 1912. By the teens the line greatly expanded to include stoves, coffee makers, meat and food choppers, toasters, wafflemakers, vacuum cleaners, bathroom fixtures, and irons. During World War I all production was devoted to military needs but following the war the company further intensified its hold on the electrical appliances market. In 1965 the Universal trademark along with the remaining assets, inventory, and equipment were acquired by the General Electric Company’s Housewares division.",,,3,"American, 1865 - 1965",,18057943,,,,,,Landers Frary & Clark,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18057943/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Kristian Vedel, known primarily for his furniture designs, was a student of Danish architect and designer Kaare Klint, founding professor of the department of furniture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Under Klint, Vedel participated in the Copenhagen Cabinet-makers’ Guild furniture exhibitions, and was honored by the Guild as early as 1947. In 1962, Vedel won the Lunning Prize (awarded to eminent Scandinavian designers) in recognition of his designs for original and innovative utilitarian products. Vedel’s designs were greatly influenced by the Bauhaus aesthetic and Klint’s standards of economy, function, and simplicity, and demonstrate a great consideration for material and production process across a variety of media. Although Vedel was best known for his furniture, his output also included product design.",,,5,"Danish, 1923 – 2003",,18057955,,,,,,Kristian Vedel,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18057955/,,,,,23424796,23424796
"Giovanni Giacomo De' Rossi was the son of the founder of the most important and active printing press of the 17th century in Rome. Begun in 1633 by his father Giuseppe (1570-1639), the press passed firstly to Giacomo and to his brother Giandomenico (1619-1653), and then later to Lorenzo Filippo (1682-?); in 1738 it became the Calcografia Camerale, from 1870 until 1945 the Regia Calcografica, and today it is known as the Calcografia Nazionale. Here are conserved, amongst many others, the plates of Giambattista Piranesi (1720-1778). Giacomo De' Rossi was the most involved of all the various family members who ran the press, and he worked between 1638 and 1691, and was to take the company to the height of its success. The artists that he printed the etchings for included Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (1609-1665), Pietro Testa (1612-1650) and Giovan Francesco Grimaldi (1606-1680).

"Brothers and designers, Ronan (b. 1971) and Erwan (b. 1976) Bouroullec, were born and raised in Quimper, France. During their studies at the École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs in Paris and at the École des Beaux-Arts in Cergy-Pontoise, they collaborated in several independent design projects. In 1999, they officially joined as partners and established their own design firm. Ronan and Erwan’s collaboration is enriched by their distinct hard-working personalities and shared aspirations for producing high-quality, balanced design. They have created comprehensive collections that range from small domestic objects (vases, porcelain, dishware, jewelry, and other accessories), office and home furniture, to larger interior and architectural projects. Their aesthetic can be defined as “poetic and practical” because their designs provide a variety of solutions and customization.  

In 1997, they were acknowledged by Giulio Cappellini who presented their first industrial design projects: the Closed Bed and the Spring Chair.  In the early 2000s, the brothers worked with Issey Miyake in designing interior spaces, Vitra in creating a new office system, Kvadrat in making textile wall systems, and with Magis in designing two extensive furniture collections. They continue to work with these manufacturers, as well as with Herman Miller, Kartell, Established and Sons, Ligne Roset, Axor, Alessi, Mattiazzi, Flos, Mutina, Hay, and Iittala. 

Their awards include Designers of the Year at the Salon du Meuble (2002) and The Danish Design Award in Copenhagen (2010).  A number of their objects have been showcased or acquired by design museums, most notably the Victoria and Albert Museum, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Design Museum in London, the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and Cooper Hewitt.

"Giovanni “Gio” Ponti (1891-1979) was an architect, writer, painter, founding editor of Domus magazine, and a pioneer of Italy’s post-war design renaissance. A passionate propagandist for modernist architecture and design at all scales, Ponti lectured in 24 countries; worked in architecture and design for 120 companies, building in 13 countries; and as an editor and writer, produced 560 magazine issues over the course of his 60-year career. 
Ponti studied architecture at Milan Polytechnic until he left to fight in the Italian army in World War I. After the war, he completed his degree, but shifted his career path to work for a ceramics manufactury, Richard Ginori, until 1930. In 1928, he founded Domus magazine as a place to promote his views on twentieth-century industrial design and champion designers and artists whose work he admired. He left Domus and founded Stile, an art and design magazine, in 1941, only to resume editorship at Domus six years later. His dedication to promoting Italian design also included his involvement in the Trienniales in Milan.  
The word “domus” signifies “typical houses”—the Milanese houses Ponti designed beginning in the 1920s that are outwardly conventional, but whose innovative interiors include flexible spaces and modular furniture. He promoted a harmony of form and function, and proper use of materials. 
Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, in addition to his editorships, Ponti worked on a range of design projects, from university headquarters, stage sets and costumes, Murano glass, to his 1948 La Pavoni coffee machine, a symbol of Italian coffee bar culture. In the 1950s, he focused on industrial design, including the Superleggera chair, so light a child could lift it with a finger. His 1960s and 1970s commissions include the Hotels Parco dei Principi in Rome and Sorrento, various villas in Italy, Taranto Cathedral, Church of San Francesco in Milan, and other commissions. 
Ponti died in Milan in 1979.",,,4,"Italian, 1891 - 1979",,18050709,,,,,,Gio Ponti,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050709/,,,,,23424853,23424853

"Frank O. Gehry is a Canadian-American architect and Pritzker-Prize winner best known for his deconstructivist buildings. Monumental architectural structures in sweeping, curving lines have come to represent Gehry’s work, most notably the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. 

Gehry experimented with furniture design in the late 1960s before he became a household name. His first introduction to furniture-making was in 1954, designing furniture for enlisted soldiers while serving in the United States Army. Before becoming immersed in architecture, Gehry also designed museum exhibitions, which allowed him to understand how three-dimensional objects inhabit a space.",,,6,"American, born Canada, 1929",,18053195,,,,,,Frank O.

"The New England Glass Company made a large variety of glassware, from pocket bottles and tumblers to art glass, using a range of techniques including molding, mechanical pressing, cutting, and engraving. It produced some of the finest blown glass in the United States, competitive with European examples. The glass had a high lead content, simple outlines, and was carefully finished. The firm was also famous for its rich colors, especially ruby red and the amberina range, a blended colored glass in which the lower part, a yellowish amber, merges into a ruby-red color higher up. An example of American technological innovation, the amberina technique was patented by the New England Glass Company in 1883.

The New England Glass Company was located in East Cambridge, Massachusetts, from about 1818 until 1888, when a strike forced its closing. Rather than go out of business, however, the company’s owner, Edward D. Libbey, moved the factory to Toledo, Ohio, where it still exists as the Libbey-Owens Ford Company.",,,1,"East Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA",,18053137,,,,,,New England Glass Company,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053137/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Alvar Aalto was born in 1898 in Kuortane, Finland, and studied architecture at the Helsinki University of Technology from 1916 to 1921. He opened his own architectural practice in 1923. His first major project, the design of the Viipuri Library, provided Aalto with the ideas that coalesced in his design of the Paimio Sanatorium, a tuberculosis sanatorium named for the town in Finland in which it is located. From 1929 to 1933, Aalto designed the facility and its furnishings, exemplifying the modernist ideals of an all-encompassing design program. 

Aalto’s stamp on modernism is characterized by the use of natural materials, minimal and functional organic forms, and also by exploring the human side of design. Throughout his career, Aalto was an influential figure in 20th-century architecture, town planning, furniture, lighting and glass. Besides the Viipuri and Paimio buildings, his numerous architectural projects included the 1929 exhibition commemorating the 700th anniversary of the Finnish city of Turku, the Finnish pavilions at the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne in Paris, and the 1939 New York World’s Fair and the Opera House, in Essen, Germany (designed 1959), now known as the Aalto Theatre.",,,6,"Finnish, 1898–1976",,18053139,,,,,,Alvar Aalto,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18053139/,,,,,23424812,23424812

"The Consolidated Lamp and Glass Company was formed through an 1893 merger of two firms in Pennsylvania and Ohio. After a fire destroyed the Ohio factory 1895, the company moved its operation to Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. The firm introduced its new line of iridescent glass, called royal copper, in 1893 and showed it at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Prior to the 1920s, the company produced mainly lamps and shades, but later turned to glass tableware and giftware. Its most popular wares were produced in the 1920s and imitated such manufacturers as Lalique. The modernist Ruba Rombic line, introduced in 1928, became its most popular design. The line was so popular that even when Consolidated shut down its plant from 1933-36, due to the Great Depression, the company allowed another glass factory to use its molds and manufacture the design.

"Reuben Haley was a glass designer, metal smith, and sculptor. He was chief designer for United States Glass Company and eventually became vice president of the firm. He left the company and established his own design firm, Metal Products Company, and produced designs for ceramics as well as glass. In 1925 he visited the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris, where he saw examples of European modernist design and art. Soon after his return, he designed a geometric ceramic teaset for the Fulper Pottery Company of New Jersey, and in 1928 he created the Ruba Rombic glassware line for the Consolidated Lamp & Glass Company in Pennsylvania. Haley was one of a few designers who first modeled their glassware designs in clay. His designs show the influence of both contemporary Czechoslovakian ceramics and cubism, and are notable as early examples of modernist design produced by American manufacturers.",,,1,"American, 1872 - 1933",,18045175,,,,,,Reuben Haley,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045175/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Vally Wieselthier was a potter and a sculptor. From 1914 to 1920, she studied at the Wienerkunstgewerbeschule (Vienna School for Applied Arts), where she trained under Josef Hoffmann and Kolo Moser, and was influenced by Dagobert Peche. She had been designing for Wiener Werkstatte since 1912, but in 1922, Vally opened her own studio. Five years later, she was invited to head the ceramics department at the Wiener Werkstatte. Known for her playful sculptures and Art Deco designs, Vally showed at the 1925 Exposition des Arts Décoratifs in Paris which helped define the Art Deco mood. She began traveling to New York in 1928 producing designs for Contempora Group and the Sebring Pottery Company, and in 1932 permanently moved there.",,,12,"Austrian, 1895–1945",,18045107,,,,,,Valerie (Vally) Wieselthier,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045107/,,,,,23424750,23424750

"Founded in 1881 by Swedish glassblower Petter Magnus Abrahamsson, Iittala was initially staffed by Swedish workers and became known for its high quality wares. In 1915 and 1917 respectively, the Ahlström firm acquired the Karhula and Iittala glassworks, and the company became known as karhula-Iittala.  By the 1930s, karhula-Iittala sponsored design competitions, two won by the husband and wife modernist architects/designers, Alvar and Aino Aalto. The company became the largest utility and art glass producer in Finland. Finnish designer Tapio Wirkala won its 1946 competition, and subsequently became chief designer at the company, helping the firm, and modern Scandinavian design, gain international recognition in the post-war years. Major designers engaged by the company from the mid-twentieth century to the present include: Timo Sarpaneva, Jorma Venola, and Oiva Toika of Finland, Australian Mark Newson, and more recently, the French brothers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec. From the 1950s onward, Iittala has been recognized for its work with designers, and a corporate philosophy that emphasizes functional and timeless design.",,,20,founded 1881,,18044545,,,,,,Iittala Glassworks,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044545/,,,,,,

"Jacques-François Blondel was the father of Georges-François Blondel (ca. 1730-ca. 1790), draughtsman and engraver, and Jean-Baptiste Blondel (1764-1825), architect. He first studied architecture with Jean-François Blondel and later with Gilles Marie Oppenord. He was elected at the Académie royale d'architecture in 1754 or 1755. In 1739 or 1746, Blondel founded his own school of architecture. In 1756 or 1762 he was named professor at the Académie Royale d'Architecture, thus ending his own school.

"Kendall lives and works in London. She attended the Royal College of Art in London and the Fine Art Printmaking in Manchester, UK. She began designing wallpaper in 1996. Her style can be used for residential or commercial spaces with its bold graphic appearance: monumental flowers, cutlery, and feathers. In 2002, Kendall broke with the traditional that wallpaper should be a two-dimensional decoration by creating 3D wallpaper made of cut strands of paper that float into the space. For this bold expression, she won the 2002 ICFF Editor’s Award for Wall Coverings.",,,2,"British, n.d.",,18061677,,,,,,Tracy Kendall,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18061677/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"Norman Bel Geddes was born in Michigan in 1893 and raised in New Philadelphia, Ohio. His creative career begins in theater design first  in Los Angeles in 1916, and later for the Metropolican Opera in New York in 1918. Bel Geddes, who is best known for his commerical and industrial designs, opened his own Industrial Design studio in 1927. Perhaps  most notable of Bel Geddes' career is his popularization of the streamlined aesthetic which is particular to American Art Deco. Bel Geddes applied this sleek, aerodynamic look to a variety of commercial forms from cars, trains, and planes to telephones, radios, and buildings.",,,2,"American, 1893–1958",,18061605,,,,,,Norman Bel Geddes,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18061605/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Henry Varnum Poor was born in Chapman Kansas in 1887. He attended public schools in Kansas City and practiced drawing throughout high school. Poor went to Stanford University where he studied economics in addition to art and was a Phi Beta Kappa. Following graduation in 1910, Poor embarked on a bicycle tour of Europe with his art professor, Arthur B. Clark.  He remained abroad and first studied at the Académie Julian in Paris under Jacques Emile Blanch and Lucien Simon. Then he moved to London, where he took night classes at the London County Council Schools with the painter Walter Sickert. Poor attended the show “Manet and the Post-Impressionists” that included works by Cezanne, Derain, Picasso, Rouault, and Matisse at London’s Grafton Gallery that would have a lasting impact. After a year in Europe, Poor returned to Stanford University and taught drawing and painting in the art department and later taught at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco. He was drafted into the war and was appointed the “regimental artist,” making portrait drawings of fellow soldiers. Following his military service, Poor settled in a community of artists in New City, New York where he purchased land and began building a home called Crow House. Ascertaining that he could not make a living as a full-time painter, Poor taught himself pottery and primarily turned to the production of bowls, plates, vases, pitchers, and tiles in the 1920s. In 1928 he helped to organize the American Designers Gallery where he exhibited a bathroom done in his own decorative tiles. In 1930, moved to Europe to paint, later returning again to the United States where he added works in fresco to his oeuvre. Poor’s numerous mural works included frescoes for the U.S. Departments of Justice (1936) and the Interior (1938) in Washington, D.C. In 1940 Poor was appointed as a Commissioner of Fine Arts, a group that oversaw decoration of federal buildings in Washington, D.C. and in 1943, he was appointed to the War Department Art Advisory Committee. In 1946 he founded the Skowhegan (Maine) School of Painting and Sculpture. Poor moved to Rome where he became resident artist at the American Academy in 1950, which led to an appointment as professor of painting at Columbia University in 1952.",,,7,"American, 1888 – 1971",,18051153,,,,,,Henry Varnum Poor,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051153/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Retail establishment and product design. Design Research, Inc. (D/R), founded in 1953 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by architect Benjamin Thompson, specialized in the latest post- war products for the modern home. The displays in the stores were considered unique in that they were designed at domestic scale and the products were shown in realistic, homelike arrangements. Products were sought and selected based on the anticipated preferences of customers, not on traditional retail buying patterns. As the time, the availability of ""good design"" was limited to wholesale firms such as Herman Miller and Knoll. Thompson was the first to introduce the work of many European and Asian designers to the American retail market, including the work of the design firm of Marimekko for wich D/R was the exclusive U.S. representative. The company also created many of its own products including chairs manufactured by Thonet. D/R later opened stores in New York City, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Thompson's own architectural firm, Benjamin Thompson & Associates, Inc., designed all of the D/R stores. For the San Francisco store, Thompson renovated the former Ghirardelli Chocolate factory. Even after the stores officially closed in 1978, D/R remained a model for many merchants.",,,5,"American, 1953 – 1979",,18051185,,,,,,"Design Research, Inc.",,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051185/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Maria Kipp was born in Weihsenbrunn, Bavaria and came from a privileged family. Schools and university were recently being opened to women in Germany. In 1918, she enrolled at the Kunstgewerbschule (School of Applied Arts) in Munich. It is not clear if the Bauhaus manifesto had any impact on her education, like it did on some of her classmates. In 1920, she enrolled at the male-dominated Staatliche Hohere Fachschule für Textilindustrie (State Academy for the Textile Industry), in Münchberg, Bavaria. This was a great achievement, as the Academy had never accepted a female student before. Kipp was determined to apply her designs to industry and worked very hard to eventually become, what she called a “textile engineer.” On the weekends, she and her classmates taught themselves how mechanical looms worked by disassembling and reassembling them. After graduating from the Academy in 1923, she was reluctant to begin her career as a textile engineer because she would have to relocate to eastern Germany where the weaving mills were situated. A year later, after receiving a handloom as a gift from a friend, she launched her business.
In 1924, Kipp and her husband Ernst Haeckel moved to Los Angeles, like many Europeans during the interwar period. Alsmot as soon as they brought their looms over to California, and set up shop, they received important commissions. Some of the most important ones were to design drapery for the Los Angeles City Hall and the San Francisco Stock Exchange. Later on she would work with architects, such as Rudolph Schindler and later Richard Neutra. In addition, the Hollywood elite and major department stores began using her designs to decorate their spaces.",,,7,1900–1988,,18051165,,,,,,Maria Kipp,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051165/,,,,,,

"Thomas Lamb was an industrial designer who gained the most notoriety for his design of physiologically efficient handles. From an early age he was interested in anatomy and physiology, and wanted to become a doctor. However, financial difficulties forced him to drop out of high school and he began work in a textile design shop. During this time he studied at the Art Students League, and finally at seventeen, Lamb opened his own textile design studio. His designs for home goods became very popular during the 1920s and were sold in major New York City department stores. He also created illustrations for books and magazines such as “Good Housekeeping"" magazine, which spurred even more designs. After World War II, Lamb turned his attention to the war effort. While at first he was designing items like “Victory napkins,” he soon turned his attention to the needs of veterans. This shift eventually led to the more ergonomic and functional work with handles. This is the work that gained him the most notoriety, and a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1948. During his long career Lamb worked with a great deal of retailers, manufactures and stores, and created a large breadth of designs for a wide range of media and products.

"Founded in 1881 by Swedish glassblower Petrus Magnus Abrahamsson, Iittala initially hired Swedish workers and became known for its high quality wares. The A. Ahlström firm acquired the Karhula and Iittala glass factories in 1915 and 1917 respectively, after which the combined company became known as Karhula-Iittala.  During the 1930s, the firm sponsored design competitions, two of them won by the modernist architects (and husband and wife) Alvar and Aino Aalto.  In 1946, Finnish designer Tapio Wirkkala won the company’s glass design competition, and subsequently became its chief designer, helping the firm, and modern Scandinavian design, gain international kudos in the post-war years. Major designers engaged by the company from the mid-twentieth century to the present include: Timo Sarpaneva, Kaj Franck, and Oiva Toika of Finland, Australian Mark Newson, and more recently, the French brothers Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec. From the 1950s onward, Iittala has been recognized for its work with designers, and a corporate philosophy that emphasizes functional and timeless design. The company eventually became the largest utility and art glass producer in Finland.",,,18,,,18058955,,,,,,"Ahlstrom-Iittala, Inc.",,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18058955/,,,,,,

"According to Gail S. Davidson interview of the designer: Frölich started training in 1921 at the Kunstgewwerbeschule in Munich.  She moved to Frankfurt in 1929.  There she became interested in architecture and interior design, specifically interiors for workers' housing--Siedlungen.   Under the architect, Ernst May, as city planning advisor, Frankfurt was a center for the Sielungen movement.  She studied for 3 years at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Frankfurt.  Then she moved to Prague where she lived until 1939, when she was forced to flee to Poland.  In Prague, she was influenced by Friedl Dicker (1898-1944) who worked as an interior designer in Prague from 1934 to 1938.  Dicker had studied with Johannes Itten in Vienna together with the artist/designer Franz Singer (1896-1954).  Dicker taught Fröhlich how to make isometric drawings.  After designing an apartment for the son of a woman in her apartment building, she had many interior design jobs for working class housing.  Three of her interiors were published in a "" to be identified"" periodical (see artist's file). From Poland she fled to London, where she had a job as model maker for Franz Singer.  When she came to the United States c. 1941, she worked first for Harrison & Fouilhoux--she executed the model for a proposed Coney Island Aquarium, Brooklyn, 1940--and then for Raymond Loewy.  From 1948-1950, she taught 3 summer courses in Home Planning and Furnishing at Columbia University's Teacher's College.  After 1950, she became headmaster of the Waldorf School and gave up her career in interior design.",,,17,"Austrian, 1901–2001",,18049589,,,,,,Margarethe Fröhlich,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049589/,,,,,23424750,23424750

"Dr. Walter Leo Hildburgh was born in New York in 1876 into a family which had emigrated to the United States in the early ninteenth century.  He attended Columbia University, where he obtained a Ph.D. and afterwards engaged in various forms of scientific research.  Since he did not have to depend for his livelihood on the proceeds of his research he was able to find time to become a figure-skater of international status, as well as a first-class swimmer.
He began to travel abroad in 1900 and therafter his life was one of travel. In that year he started a prolonged tour of Japan, China, and India.  At an early stage he began to develop as a collectior but his interest was at first attracted by folk-lore and anthropology.  Three further visits were made to the same area in the following years and he made a prolonged stay in Ceylon studying magic.  After this he passed onto the Middle East and to Europe.  In 1912 he established a base in London and therafter he never paid more than fleeting visits to the United States. ...(New York Times 11/28/55)
Dr. Holdburgh became involved with the Victoria and Albert Museum and became more invoved in collecting.  The fruits of his collecting can be seen at the Victoria and Albert Museum such as English alabasters, Spanish goldsmiths' work, Dutch, German and Italian silver, English sculpture, ivory and Italian bronzes.",,,123,1876 – 1955,,18052375,,,,,,Dr. Walter Leo Hildburgh,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18052375/,,,,,,

"Henry Van de Velde was a Dutch painter, designer, and theoretician. After studying painting in Antwerp and later in Paris, Van de Velde returned to Antwerp in 1886 where he joined the avant-garde artists' association, Les XX. In Brussels, he became increasingly influenced by English Arts and Crafts pioneers John Ruskin and William Morris and abandoned painting to pursue the design of interiors, book graphics, jewelry, and metalwork. Like Morris, Van de Velde advocated the idea that all branches of art share a common language of form and are equally important to human existence. He saw ornament not as decoration but as a logical element of the total work and as the result of formal, structural considerations. His forms evolved from plants and other natural motifs into an abstract style. He believed that contemporary design should be modern and express the needs of the day. 

Van de Velde's career can be divided into five periods based upon changes in his locale. A first Belgian period dates from 1893–1900; this was followed by an important phase in Berlin and Weimar (1900–17), where he directed the Weimar Kunstgewerbeschule (Weimar School of Arts and Crafts), a precursor to the Bauhaus. A third period was spent in Switzerland from 1917–20. A fourth phase in the Netherlands from 1921–25 was followed by a second Belgian period from 1925–48. The last 10 years of his life were spent in Switzerland. After the turn of the century, Van de Velde became very influential in the field of aesthetics through his teaching and writing. His books, The Renaissance in Modern Applied Art (1901) and A Laymen's Sermons on Applied Art (1903), were essential theoretical sources for art nouveau and for the development of 20th-century design and architecture. 

Van de Velde married in 1894; the next year he built a family home, Bloemenwerf (1895), near Brussels, for which he designed the architecture and house contents in a coherent, organic whole, down to his wife’s dresses and jewelry. The house brought Van de Velde to the attention of the art historian, critic, and publisher, Julius Meier-Graefe, and the art dealer Samuel Bing. Bing, who was opening his boutique, L’Art Nouveau, in Paris, commissioned Van de Velde to design four rooms (a dining room, two salons, and a bedroom) for his shop; the designs were subsequently shown at the Exposition des Arts Appliqués in Dresden, Germany in 1897. From this time on, Van de Velde was in great demand in Germany. The influential German periodical, Pan, published his article on the making and fabrication of modern furniture.

1898 was an important year for Van de Velde. He founded the Société Van de Velde for the popularization of construction and ornamentation and built a factory in Brussels for the production of interior furniture that was sold at Meier-Graefe’s newly-opened Parisian shop, La Maison Moderne. The same year Tropon Werke’s general manager, Eberhard von Bodenhausen, appointed Van de Velde as the firm’s director of advertising and graphic design. Van de Velde's graphics and packaging for Tropon received the respect and admiration of the entire graphic design community and appeared in multiple publications, including Pan.",,,1,"Belgian, 1863 – 1957",,18060335,,,,,,Henry Van de Velde,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18060335/,,,,,23424757,23424757

"SALT is a partnership between textile designers June Swindell and Karina Thomas, and specializes in custom window treatments for commercial and residential interiors. Swindell holds a BA in Textile Design from Liverpool University and an MA in Woven Textiles from Trent University. Thomas studied Textile Design at Leeds University and completed a Masters in Knitted Textiles at the Royal College of Art. Both teach and lecture throughout the UK. Swindell is herself a weaver, and the company also employs five additional hand-weavers in a cottage-industry model to make samples and weave their products. 

For ten years, the pair has been experimenting with the ways in which materials and textures absorb, reflect, and filter light. Because they have focused on window treatments, they are concerned with privacy, managing light, and the appearance of different materials in day and nighttime lighting. Many of their textiles play with sheerness and opacity with areas to look at and areas to look through, surfaces which attract the eye and others which allow light, and vision, to pass through.",,,3,,,18060333,,,,,,June Swindell,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18060333/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"She is a mathematician and adjunct professor at Cornell University. However, she is best known for crocheting objects to illustrate hyperbolic space. In 1991, she received her doctorate from the University of Latvia in mathematics. After seeing a flimsy paper model of hyperbolic planes in a workshop in 1997, she made a durable option by crocheting a model. These crocheted models were presented in textbooks that she and her husband co-wrote.  Taimina’s models allowed for a more approachable method to understanding hyperbolic space and geometry. She gave workshops to children and adults. Additionally, she was invited to exhibit her crocheted objects in galleries and museums.",,,1,"Latvian, active U.S.A., b. 1954",,18064203,,,,,,Daina Taimina,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18064203/,,,,,23424874,23424874

"Koons began working with his father, who owned a printing business, at an early age, practicing design by creating greeting cards and posters.  During his teenage years he continued to assist his father with client projects.  This early interest in design provided a good foundation for his undergraduate training at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York.  He has worked as an illustrator and graphic designer, creating business and brand identities as well.  His archives are located at the Hagley Museum, Delaware, and other examples of his artwork are in the collection of Yeshiva University Museum.

Irvin Louis Koons was born on March 14, 1922 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the son of Frank and Rose Koons. His father owned a printing shop. In 1938, he moved to New York City, where he attended Pratt Institute. In 1942, Koons entered military service with the U.S. Army. He was sent abroad to New Delhi, India, where Koons became the Art Director for the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations; here his main responsibility was the production of weekly newsmaps as well as brochures and other materials to keep the American troops informed. During this time he also worked as an art critic for the newspaper The Statesman.
After the conclusion of the Second World War, Koons worked as an illustrator for Random House and Simon and Schuster, and spent several years studying art abroad in France, Italy and Switzerland. In 1949 he founded his own design firm, Irv Koons Associates. Koons worked on projects for numerous companies as well as non-profit organizations. Among his most well-known clients were the American Cancer Society, Barton's Candy, Bristol Laboratories, Bloomingdale's, Metropolitan Life, Mobil, and Seagram's. 
His illustrations were featured in periodicals like Fortune, Family Circle, Seventeen, the Ladies Home Journal, Good Housekeeping, and Sports Illustrated. In 1956 Koons designed the first daily offset newspaper in the world, the Middletown Daily Record. He  created some Jewish art pieces, including Torah ornaments for the Temple Emanu-El in Closter, New Jersey in 1986 and stained glass windows for the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York in 1975.
In 1981 Irv Koons Associates was bought by the advertising firm Saatchi and Saatchi. Koons resigned his position as Chief Executive Officer and Creative Head in 1988 and accepted a voluntary appointment as the Senior Advisor to the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme. He also helped to found the International Design Assistance Commission in 1984, which is a volunteer organization that concerns itself with performing design work for developing countries.",,,12,"American, born 1922",,18064185,,,,,,Irving Louis Koons,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18064185/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Albert Herbert studied industrial design at Pratt Institute and graduated in 1950. Although his first design job in New York with the Knoll Planning Unit lasted only two years (1950–52) he maintained a close relationship with Eszter Haraszty, then director of the Knoll Textiles department. Herbert went on to have a long and productive career as a textile and interior designer. His designs were produced by L.

"Louis Sullivan (American, 1956-1924) was one of the most significant  American architects of any era. His work provides a transition from the nineteenth century academic world to the twentieth century. Like his teacher and mentor, Henry Hobson Richardson he considered the decorative elements of his buildings with a particularly keen sense of the aesthetic movement tempered with a strong architectural rationalism.  The Chicago Stock exchange of 1893 was one of Adler (Dankmar) and Sullivan's major commissions, showing a modern aesthetic when compared with the more Beaux Arts styles of some of the buildings at the contemporary World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.",,,3,"American, 1856–1924",,18050521,,,,,,Louis Henry Sullivan,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050521/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"M. Leon Decloux (b. November 11, 1840 d. May 26, 1929) belonged to a Parisian family whose members were mainly contractors of works of various sorts.  After having begun in the firm directed by his father, at the side of his eldest brother Edouard, he established a gilding shop, then a housepainting enterprise which he rapidly expanded.
He demonstrated at an early age a very marked taste for the art of the 18th century, then fairly unkown, and he was interested in all forms of the art of that era - furniture, engravings, knick-knacks, porcelain as well as the decorative style created by the 18th century artists.  While yet a young man, he began diligently frequenting the auction house and started acquiring, in proportion to his still modest means, some art ojects of quality which his natural good taste enabled him to discover in the public sales and in the antique shops.
His deep study of the style of Louis XVI led him to specialize his painting business in the execution of ornamental painting of that period and he restored, notably, the color ""Louis XVI grey"" which had entirely fallen out of fashion in the Parisian salons, replaced by the deep toned colors adopted at the end of the 19th century.  Some connoisseurs then entrusted to him the complete decoration and furnishings of several private houses of Paris.  He proved, at that time, his taste and knowledge and realized some remarkable decorative ensembles, such as the Hotels de Bretueuil, de Fels, etc.
Devoting himself more and more to the study of the art objects of the epoque of his preference, while still young, he turned over his commercial enterprise to a relative who had become his associate, to such an extent that he would be able to use all his time to collect on his own.  Among his activities in this realm he established a very complete collection of engravings of the modes of the 18th century.  It is this collection which he later sold to some connoisseurs of the United States who gave them to the New York Museum of Decorative Arts.  Up until his last years, M. Decloux did not stop folowing the large sales of art objects and frequenting the Parisian antique dealsers and he continued to group around him a most important collection of furniture and various brick-brack, always of excellent workmanship and notably among these, a very beautiful colleciton sof Severe soft paste porcelain and of porcelains and faiences of the principal French and foreign manufacturers of the 18th century.
Thus, in the course of a long life, M. Decloux, who remained unmarried, lived only for the art of the period which he loved, surrounded by precious objects which he had patiently assembled, guided only by the instinct and personal taste of a born collector.

"The Boston and Sandwich Glass Company, located in Sandwich, Massachusetts, was a top innovative producer of high quality glass in the second half of the 19th century. In 1825, Deming Jarvis started the Boston and Sandwich Glass Company in a small town on Cape Cod that was rich in fuel, had easy access to major waterways, and was located only 50 miles from Boston. Boats could dock at the plant, which facilitated the transport of goods. Despite its seaside location, Sandwich lacked fine sand, so sand was brought in from New Jersey and Western Massachusetts. Sandwich went out of business in 1888 due to labor disputes with newly-formed unions—an ironic twist as the firm had provided more worker benefits throughout its history than many other companies.",,,3,"Sandwich, Massachusetts, USA, active 1824–1888",,18050545,,,,,,Boston and Sandwich Glass Company,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050545/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Gertrude Mathilde Oppenheimer, a native New Yorker of German origin, was raised on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  Her parents, David Edward and Mathilde (née Davidson) Oppenheimer, had three children; Gertrude was the youngest.  Her father worked in New York real estate, but began his career as a diamond importer.  Eventually establishing herself on the Upper East Side, Ms. Oppenheimer led a cloistered life dedicated to collecting embroidered samplers in her Park Avenue apartment.  Her samplers were mostly acquired through dealers and antique shows in New York, with a few purchased from Germany.  As she collected, Ms. Oppenheimer recorded the details of each sampler in a ledger, noting its country of origin, from whom it was purchased and materials.

With a passion and eye for needlework, Ms. Oppenheimer amassed a collection that spans the globe dating from the seventeenth to twentieth century. The samplers come from North America, from Canada to Mexico; all across Europe, from England to Germany, Scandinavia to Italy; as well as Asia and Africa.  Although spanning a good part of the globe, Ms. Oppenheimer’s collection is especially rich in embroideries from Northern Europe, particularly England, Germany, and the Netherlands.

In 1981, the Cooper-Hewitt received the bequest of Gertrude M. Oppenheimer’s collection of over 600 samplers, along with her ledger. Over eighty percent of Ms. Oppenheimer’s collection remains with the Cooper-Hewitt, providing a snapshot survey of variations in sampler embroidery from around the world and across centuries. Ms. Oppenheimer’s bequest has added to the Cooper-Hewitt’s own collection of embroidery, a craft long considered “women’s work,” expanding the breadth of primary sources that can be analyzed to understand the representational and communicative qualities of embroidered samplers.  Samplers were intended to be educational tools upon which young girls and women could practice and refine their handiwork for the household.  Ms. Oppenheimer’s collection includes a variety of samplers related to housework, including darning, alphabets and numbers for marking linen, practice for hemming, plackets, and finishing button holes. Other samplers served as a family record with dates of births, marriages and deaths, as well as a means for mourning and commemoration. The variation in subject matter, including biblical references, nationalist symbols and flowers, reveal what was valued by the embroiderer, or at least what she was instructed to value.  These samplers are more than practices pieces; they provide insight into the personal qualities of the embroiderer and social sentiments of the day.",,,479,,,18050567,,,,,,Gertrude M.

"Born in Czechoslovakia, Mucha received his first formal training at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Munich from 1885-1887.  His patron Count Karl Khuen-Belassi, then sent him to Paris where he worked as a magazine and book illustrator.   Mucha established his reputation as an innovative designer with a series of nine lithograph posters commissioned by the actress Sarah Bernhardt along with two posters for Job cigarettes (1896 and 1898).  In these works Mucha created a unique style depicting exotic, sensuous women with long tangled hair together with densely-packed Byzantine and Moravian folk art motifs and stylized plants and flowers.   Mucha produced a number of designs for printed fabrics between 1897 and 1898.  All the designs were handled by the Paris firm of C.G. Forrer.  In addition to posters and textile designs Mucha executed designs for wallpaper, furniture, metalwork, flatware, glassware, lace and ornament all published in Documents Decorative par A.M. Mucha, Paris:  Librarie Central des Beaux-Arts, 1901.  Mucha was actively involved with the Paris 1900 Exposition Universelle, designing jewelry and a shop for Georges Fouquet.  In 1910 he returned to Bohemia where he executed a series of twenty paintings for the city of Prague in 1928.",,,12,"b. 1860 Ivancice, Moravia  –  d. 1939 Prague, Czechoslovakia",,18043027,,,,,,Alphonse Maria Mucha,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043027/,,,,,23424810,23424810

"The Daum glassworks began as a bottle factory in Nancy and was acquired in the 1870s by Jean Daum (Verrerie de Nancy).  Production gradually became specialized in fine glassware.  Taken over in 1885-87 by his two sons, Auguste (trained as a lawyer) and Antonin (newly graduated from the École central des arts et manufactures), the firm soon began producing colored glass, and in 1891 opened a decoration studio, employing artists, including Henri Bergé, Eugène Damman, and Jacques Gruber, who created the pieces that were exhibited by the Daum firm at the World Colombian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. The Daum works produced layered glass like Emile Gallé’s, and gradually perfected several original and difficult techniques, such as decoration using colored glass powder either fired onto the surface or sealed beneath another layer of glass, wheel cutting, martelage (producing a hammered texture), mold-blowing, etching, and use of applied elements. Two specialties emerged: berluzes (long-necked vases, rising from a low round base) and lamps. In 1906, Daum provided a studio for Almeric Walter, where he produced pâte-de-verre objects.  In the 1920s, the firm’s designs turned to the Art Deco style. Daum continues producing wares to this day, primarily featuring high-end artistic crystal.",,,18,"founded 1878, Nancy, France",,18049179,,,,,,Daum,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049179/,,,,,23424819,23424819

"The son of a tailor, Bosse was born in 1602 in Tours, France.  He was active as an engraver in Paris by the age of 20, living on the Ile du Palais.  His earliest works were based on designs of other artists including Jacques Bellange and Jean de Saint-Igny.  The collaborated with Jacques Callot during Callot's stay in Paris in 1629-1631.  By 1625, Bosse was in touch with Melchior Tavernier, the Flemish engraver and printer who until his death in 1641, published many of Bosse's works.  He was a friend of some of the intellectuals of his time.  Pierre Desargues, the mathematician and friend of Descartes, was Bosse's friend.  
     Bosse taught perspective at the Royal Academy of Painting and Scuupture beginning in 1648.  His lectures were published in 1665 as Traité des practiques géomètrales et perspectives... He was made an Honorary academician in 1651, but then after arguments with Charles Le Brun and others, he was excluded from membership.  His views on theory and practive were published in 1667 in Le Peintre converty aux précises et universelles règles de son art.  
     His career falls into two phases.  The first starts in 1622 and runs to 1641, when his publisher Tavernier dies.  From the 1640s on he was active mainly as a writier, illustrator, and sometimes as a publisher, and he made few independent plates.  He appears to become less active as a print maker in his later years.  Bosse seems also to have been active as a painter, though few of his paintings have been identified.",,,3,"French, 1602–1676",,18049155,,,,,,Abraham Bosse,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049155/,,,,,23424819,23424819

"The Computer-Tabulating-Recording Company, which would later become known as International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), was the product of a 1911 merger between the International Time Recording Company, the Tabulating Machine Company and the Computing Scale Company. Founded by Thomas J. Watson, Sr., CTR officially became International Business Machines in 1924. The company manufactured a variety of information processing products, playing a major part in US history when the government began using its punched card machines to manage Social Security record keeping in 1935 and tabulating machines to keep track of WWII freight traffic in 1942. After developing the first computer in conjunction with Harvard University in 1944, IBM increasingly focused on business computing, and later personal computing, contributing major advancements to the industry, such as commercial hard disk drives. As the market for computers has grown, IBM has changed its emphasis from selling computers directly to customers to providing computing-related services for a huge variety of companies and consumers. In 2011, IBM celebrated its 100th year in business.

She began weaving as a child and later enrolled at California College of Arts & Crafts, in Oakland, CA, where she majored in textiles. As a child, her parents had collected many Japanese objects, and these, particularly kimonos, inspired O’Hara’s designs.

"Audiovisual equipment manufacturer Bang & Olufsen was founded in 1925 when engineers Peter Bang and Svend Olufsen established the company in Struer, Denmark. Bang & Olufsen originally produced loud speakers and sound recording systems for the film industry, as well as the innovative Bakelite-cased Beolit 39 radio introduced in 1938. The company was forced to rebuild during WWII when its factory was destroyed by the Nazis, but the firm regained ground after the war as it produced state-of-the-art radios and television sets. By the late 20th century, the company had its own retail stores and was expanding its production to include mobile phones, DVD players and MP3 devices. After the economic crisis of 2008, however, Bang & Olufsen scaled its operation back to high fidelity musical and video reproduction. Today, the company produces portable speakers, televisions, head phones and automotive speaker systems, commissioning popular designers to give its products a streamlined, sleek look for an international market.

"The museum’s first advisory council was established in 1907 by George A. Hearn. Composed of prominent philanthropists, industrialists, and artists, including J. P. Morgan, Jacob Schiff, and Louis Comfort Tiffany, the Council generously financed and advised on collections for the museum until it disbanded in 1927. 

Eleanor wrote in 1919 that, before their yearly travel to Europe, members of the Council gave Sarah and Eleanor ""large checks to buy the best that could be found to enhance the beauty and working qualities of the Museum."" She continued, ""with munificence past belief, the Council has facilitated the purchase of hundreds of unique objects . . . which have been fruitful sources of inspiration and in constant use by artist artisans.""

After 1930, an Advisory Council composed of Sarah and Eleanor’s dedicated friends, including Mrs. Montgomery Hare, Susan Dwight Bliss, and Edith Wetmore, continued to guide the museum.",Founded to provide advice and funding for the museum’s collections,"The museum’s first advisory council was established in 1907 by George A.

"A native of the Pacific Northwest, Tom Kundig comes from a craft-based design culture rooted in the area’s industrial and timber heritage. As an accomplished alpine climber, Kundig is familiar with the rugged outdoors of tall trees, rocks, lakes, big sky, as well as with ropes and other mountaineering equipment, all of which have influenced his architectural practice. His early work as a sculptor’s assistant, fabricating large-scale welded steel sculptures, has encouraged his fascination with jerry-rigged machines and apparatuses to move and balance heavy pieces. And, as a devotee of low-tech solutions and experimentation, he enjoys collaboration with engineers and craftspeople as well as with his clients, whose goals and desires actively shape his projects.

Kundig, a partner in the Seattle firm, Olson Sundberg Kundig Allen, was a National Design Award winner in 2008 for his Rolling Huts in Mazama, Washington.

"Edward Mcnight Kauffer was born in Great Falls, Cascade County, Montana on 14 December 1890. He grew up in the small town of Evansville on the Ohio River in Indiana, where the Kauffer grandparents had settled. After the divorce of their parents, he spent two years in an orphanage. By the age of four or five he had begun to draw. His mother remarried in 1899. Kauffer left school at the age of 12 or 13 to be helper to the scene painter in the City Directory. In the Elder Bookshop and Art Rooms in San Francisco Kauffer acquired not only a speaking voice of marked attractiveness and distinction but also a life-long passion for books. He continued his studies as a painter by receiving his first formal training at evening sessions at the Mark Hopkins Institute. He met Professor McKnight, who became his patron; in homage to him Kauffer adopted the name of McKnight. A small exhibition of Kauffer's paintings was held at the Elder Art Rooms. From 1912 to 1913 he was a student at the Art Institute of Chicago. Kauffer reached Paris in the autumn of 1913. On July 1914 he married an American concert pianist, Grace Ehrlich, and together, they left for England. Kauffer had tried over 25 London companies unsuccessfully when he met Frank Pick, the Publicity Manager of the London Underground Electric Railways. The first posters for the London Underground Railways appeared in 1915. Over the next 25 years the company became his major client and he their major posters artist. During the five years period 1916-1921 Kauffer was an increasingly exhibited painter who seemed to be at home with all of the different, and sometimes warring, elements of the English avant-garde, but he was also an increasingly successful designer. A more interesting commission for which Kauffer produced designs throughout this period was initiated by the Manchester textile company Steinthal & Company A.P. Simon.
Kauffer regularly provided posters, sets and costumes for the Art League of Service, founded in London in 1919. He's career as a painter finished in 1920 with his resignation from the London Group, the failure of X Group. In 1921 he was sufficiently in funds to attempt to establish himself as a designer in New York. He returned to London in the spring of 1922. On his return Kauffer resumed work on a set of posters commissioned by Pick to advertise the principal museums in London. Others clients in this period were Gerald Meynell and Cyril Eastman. It was probably a useful step for Kauffer to join Sir William Crawford's agency, which was alive to continental developments in graphic design.
In the thirties Kauffer became a very public figure in Britain. In this period many exhibitions of Kauffer's works were held England.
He worked for Cresta Silk and Orient Line. Peter Gregory was one sheet-anchor for Kauffer in the thirties, Jack Beddington was another and made most of his new opportunities. Kauffer's collaboration with Ninette de Valois and Arthur Bliss to create Checkmate in 1937 was his first and last triumph in the theatre. Kauffer bought a small Regency house in Buckinghamshire, North End, where he occupied himself reading Kierkegaard and Dante and tried his hand at illustrating the ""Inferno"". He showed his work in Chicago, New York and designed for Barnum and Bailey's Circus, the New York Subways Advertising Co Inc., Container Corporation, American Silk Mills, many War Relief  Associations, Alfred Knopf, the Modern Library, Harcourt Brace, Random House, Pantheon Books and other companies. Kauffer began to lose interest in the New York advertising scene. A friend of his said that he chose to kill himself with drink. He continued to work to the end, almost obsessively. Kauffer died on 22 October 1954.",,,491,"American, active England, 1890–1954",,18041923,,,,,,Edward McKnight Kauffer,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18041923/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Industrial, interior, and packaging designer. Born Blue Earth, Minnesota, November 23, 1894. By 1943, he had established Donald Deskey Associates in New York. Along with Dreyfuss, Bel Geddes, and Loewy, Deskey was one of the great industrial design pioneers in the 1930s. He is best known for his designs for the furnishings and interiors of Radio City Music Hall in 1932, and for his work for companies such as: Widdicomb Furniture Company, Grand Rapids, Michigan; W. & J. Sloane, New York; and Estey Manufacturing Company, Owosso, Michigan. In addition, Deskey is known for his familiar packaging designs for Procter & Gamble products, such as Crest toothpaste, Prell shampoo, and Tide detergent. Donald Deskey Associates also was responsible for lamppost # 10, the streetlight still in use today in New York City.

"Lino Sabattini is one of Italy’s leading silversmiths and designers. Sabattini is self-taught: he sharpened his sensibilities and craft while a young man during World War II, he assiduously read the design magazine Domus, and studied materials and metalsmithing techniques while working in a brassware shop. Sabattini later served an informal apprenticeship with the refugee German ceramist, Roland Hettner. It was during this period that Sabattini first became interested in shapes derived from the behavior of materials.

By 1955, he settled in Milan where he met Gio Ponti, who encouraged his design practice and exhibited his work the following year, which brought Sabattini to international attention. From 1956–63, while still active in Milan he was the Director of Design for Christofle Orfèvrerie, Paris. His silver designs during that period could be characterized as sculptural and free-flowing. Sabattini established his own manufactory in Bregnano, near Como, Italy, in 1964, and started to garner awards in that decade. His standards of quality and his individual approach to the language of design have made him one of the leading figures in Italian modernism.",,,7,b. 1925,,18042469,,,,,,Lino Sabattini,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042469/,,,,,23424853,23424853

"Born near Genoa, Giani began his studies in Pavia with Carlo Bianchi and Antonio Galli Bibiena. He moved to Bologna in 1778 where he studied with Domenico Pedrini and Ubaldo Gandolfi.  He traveled to Rome in 1780 to study with Pompeo Batoni, Giuseppe Antolini and Christoph Unterberger at the Academy of San Luca.
From 1784 to 1794, after begining his career as a decorator of Roman palazzi, he lived in Bologna and Faenza, and accepted commission in Emilia and Romagna.

"In 1989, Sam Farber, former CEO of the cookware manufacturer Copco, decided to establish the kitchen utensil manufacturer OXO International, inspired by his arthritic wife’s difficulty gripping a potato peeler. Farber considered many kitchen tools to be “functional disasters” and contemplated what could be done for his wife and the more than 20 million Americans with arthritis.[1] He noted that, even for the average user, “ordinary kitchen tools hurt your hands, with painful scissor loops... [and] hard skinny handles.”[2] Farber wondered: if you made comfortable tools, wouldn’t everybody use them?

"Marian Bantjes (b. 1963) began working in the field of visual communication in 1983 and from 1984 to 1994 worked as typesetter.   From 1994 to 2003 she and a partner established the firm Digitopolis that produced materials for corporations, education and arts organizations.  In 2003 she left this firm to create a more personal style combining type and ornament that has allowed her to cross boundaries between fine arts and design, illustration and typography.  Bantjes' highly original approach has brought her international recognition.  Her clients include Saks Fifth Avenue, Penguin Books, Houghton Mifflin, and other designers including Michael Bierut at Pentagram and Stefan Sagmeister, as well as many design magazines such as Print and Wallpaper.  She teaches typography at Emily Carr Institute in Vancouver, Canada.  At a 2010 Ted Talk, Marian Bantjes spoke eloquently about what drives her approach to visual communication.  She said she enjoys figuring out things, using unusual materials, and experimenting with the interdependency of word and image.  But most of all, she searches for the unexpected, incorporating wonder and surprise.  Her characteristic objects use Vector graphics and obsessive hand work and patterning.",,,14,"Canadian, b. 1963",,18060549,,,,,,Marian Bantjes,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18060549/,,,,,23424775,23424775

"Ralph Schraivogel is internationally acknowledged as one of the most important and influential contemporary poster designers, and certainly the most significant contemporary Swiss designer. 

The graphic designer Keith Godard said of Schraivogel, “The phonetic translation of his name (screaming bird) is a fitting analogy: his posters are always ‘in your face,’ never using quiet or orderly typography so often equated with the Swiss.” This statement sums up where and how Schraivogel has positioned himself in relation to the expected rational model of Swiss graphic design, which typically incorporates combinations of typography and photography—or typography alone—on a tightly controlled mathematical grid. 

Trained in Zurich at the Schule für Gestaltung (1977–82), Schraivogel acknowledges no particular Swiss models or influences from his field. In fact, he prides himself on working outside of any particular movement.[1] Schraivogel has said, “As a designer, I’m not allowed to bore people. I need to make a surprising picture, like fire-works.” Schraivogel rejects the expected look and approach to poster design, in which the designer starts to sketch ideas towards a graphic solution. Instead he relies on chance, on “unforeseeable stray tracks and detours to expand his means of expression.” He will sometimes focus on randomly encountered patterns or graphic structures of his own invention, using them to get into the mood for a new idea or to arrive at a unique solution for each commission. 

Regarding his approach to the use of space, Schraivogel has said that growing up he admired the painter, El Greco, and the printmaker, M. C. Escher, for their ways of representing space. El Greco depicted figures in undefined, cavernous, light-filled spaces that were not contained by the frame. Similarly, Schraivogel’s compositions seem not to be contained by the frame. His other model, Escher, created totally confounding, warped and illogical spatial puzzles that have no resolution. Schraivogel perpetually plays with pattern, image, and type to create ambiguous illusions of space without using perspective, “so that you can’t imagine how the paper remains flat."" Visual inventiveness characterizes Schraivogel’s career.

"Alexandre Benois was a painter, watercolorist, illustrator, and writer best known
for his stage décor and costume designs for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. The
son and grandson of court architects, Benois was brought up within the Russian
imperial entourage. His father worked at Peterhof and later at Pavlovsk, and was
responsible for the Bolshoy Theatre in Moscow and the Mariinsky Theatre in St.
Petersburg (Crisp, Clement. ""Alexandre Nikolaevich Benois,"" in Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research 13, no. 2, 1995: 47-48). 

Benois first began his study of painting in St. Petersburg between 1887 and 1888, and from 1891 to about 1910 he participated in exhibitions of the Society of Russian Watercolorists. Around 1898, Benois founded the magazine Mir Iskousstva (The World of Art) with Diaghilev and Léon Bakst. In 1909, at the same time he was designing for the Ballets Russes, he exhibited a suite of paintings entitled Promenade de Louis XIV dans le parc de Versailles. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Benois continued to be engaged in the fine arts. He served as director of the Picture Gallery of the Hermitage Museum from 1917 until he left Russia for Paris in 1926.

Like his brother, Alt began studying art with his father, trained at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Vienna, and began his artistic career by about 1844. While based in Vienna throughout his life, Alt traveled widely in the Tyrol, northern Italy, and central Europe, making studies of landscapes and picturesque views of local architecture. One of his first albums of watercolors, commissioned by Count Casimir Esterházy, contained views of the northern Italian town Tarvisio and its vicinity.

"Joris Laarman (b. 1979) has had a meteoric rise in the design profession since his years at the Eindhoven Design Academy.  While still a student there he designed as his thesis project the Heat Wave Radiator (featured in Cooper-Hewitt's Rococo exhibition and subsequently acquired for the collection, 2008-13-1-a/c).  Upon graduation in 2003, he started his own company, Joris Laarman Studio, focusing on product design and architecture.  In 2004, with film maker and partner Anita Star, Laarman founded Joris Laarman Lab. Laarman is particularly interested in working at the intersection of science and aesthetics.  Before 2007, he came across the work of a German scientist, Claus Metthek, who developed an algorithm (based on the regenerative structure of bones which allows them to add and subtract matter as needed) for the Opal car company, which enabled them to produce car parts that were optimized for strength and minimal materials use.  He applied a form of this technology to produce his break-through Bone Chair which debuted at the Milan Furniture Fair in 2007 and the following year was featured in MoMA’s exhibition Design and the Elastic Mind.  Since his 2010 solo exhibition at Friedman Benda Gallery (his first in the US), from which Cooper Hewitt acquired the ""Design for the Leaf Table,"" Laarman has been working on his Maker series of chairs and other furniture produced by 3-D printers or CNC millling, where people can produce their own design example on their 3-D printers or give the blueprints to a fabricator for production.",,,3,"Dutch, b. 1979",,18060585,,,,,,Joris Laarman,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18060585/,,,,,23424909,23424909

"Mary Ellen Best was born in York, England, the younger of two daughters of
well-to-do doctor Charles Best and his wife Mary. Her father died when she was
eight, and left a bequest to both children, guaranteeing in some measure their freedom to pursue an education and not be forced into marriage for financial support as adults. 

Mary Ellen and her sister Rosamond attended boarding school and were both likely taught painting privately prior to their lessons with George Haugh (1755–1827), a successful painter who exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy (Davidson, Caroline. The World of Mary Ellen Best. London: Chatto & Windus, 1985: 16). Best lived with her mother after her schooling, and they often traveled together through England, Germany, and the Netherlands. Family documents indicate that Mary Ellen was actively painting watercolors and selling her works as early as 1831. After the 1850s, she seems to have given up painting. She recorded her career by pasting a number of her best paintings chronologically into albums; nearly all of these albums have now been dispersed.

"Anna Alma-Tadema began her artistic training at a very young age under the tutelage of her father, Dutch-born painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836–1912). Anna was the youngest daughter from her father’s first marriage. After his wife’s death in 1869, Alma-Tadema married one of his pupils, Laura Thèrése Epps, who became a respected artist. Anna Alma-Tadema’s debut seems to have been at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1885, where two studies she submitted were “indicative of much promise” (New York Times, May 17, 1885). Another view of Townshend House in Regent’s Park, London, may have been painted prior to 1885, when Alma-Tadema and his family moved to the house formerly owned by James Tissot in Grove End Road, in St. John’s Wood.

"Edward Lamson Henry was born in Charleston, South Carolina; at the age of
seven, he was brought to live with relatives in New York. He began studying art
at fourteen with Walter Oddie (1808–1865), a landscape painter and early
member of the National Academy of Design. Henry furthered his study with Paul
Weber (1823–1916) at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and in Paris as a
student of Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury (1797–1890) at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.
He later traveled through Rome and Florence. In 1859, Henry began exhibiting
yearly at the National Academy of Design; two years later he received the status of
full Academician. From 1875 to 1879, Henry lived in London and exhibited at the Royal Academy and Suffolk Street Gallery, and exhibited at both the 1878 and 1889 Expositions Universelles, receiving an honorable mention for his submission to the latter. After returning to the United States, he spent summers in a small artist/farming community in upstate New York known as Cragsmoor, which frequently appeared as the subject of his landscape and genre paintings from the late 1870s onward.

"Jan Lenica was a Polish graphic designer and cartoonist. He was born in 1928 in Poznań, Poland. Lenica cited his father, the artist Alfred Lenica as the single most significant influence on his work. Both father and son shared a belief in Modern art as well as a reverence for Max Ernst, the French Surrealists and the Polish surrealists.  A teenager when the Second World War ended, Lenica’s oeuvre also reflects the experience of death and the loss of identity.  In the years immediately following the war, Lenica earned money drawing political cartoons that appeared in both Communist newspapers and cultural journals.  
After graduating from the Architecture Department at Warsaw Polytechnic, Lenica worked as a poster illustrator as well as a collaborator on Walerian Borowczyk’s early animation films. Lenica introduced sophisticated graphics to the field of animated film and remained extremely influential in into the early 1960s, serving as the first professor of animation at the University of Kassel in Germany, while continuing to teach graphic design and poster illustration.  By the mid-1970s, Lenica had largely dismissed his concern with a political or social agenda took on larger corporate work for clients including the Olympic Committee and the German Sparkasse Bank. Lenica is represented in museum collections throughout the world, and was the receipt of numerous awards, including the Max Ernst Gold Medal Prize from the International Poster Biennale in Warsaw in 1966.",,,4,"Polish, 1928 - 2001",,18062853,,,,,,Jan Lenica,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18062853/,,,,,23424923,23424923

"Japanese-American artist Tomoko Miho was awarded the 1993 AIGA medal. She attended the Minneapolis School of Art and the Art Center School in Los Angeles, earning a degree in industrial design. Miho was first employed by Harley Earl Associates as a packaging designer. She and husband, Jim, toured Europe and met with renowned designers. Upon her return from Europe, she went to work for George Nelson and Co. in New York, as a graphic designer. Miho later became head of graphic design department of Irving Harper’s firm. She also designed for Herman Miller and many other important design companies over the years. Miho launched her own company, Tomoko Miho Co. Miho looked at space differently, applying what, in Japanese, is called “shakkei.” Shakkei is the way that the background is integrated into the foreground, transforming the experience of a space and also allowing for a sense of completeness within a small environment. Miho used this sensibility in all facets of her design aesthetic.",,,5,"American, 1931–2012",,18062847,,,,,,Tomoko Miho,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18062847/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Josef Müller-Brockman was a pioneering force in the Swiss school of graphic design and one of the most internationally respected members of his design generation.  The Swiss style grew out of European and Russian modernist graphics including constructivist, French modernist, Futurist, Dada, De Stijl and Bauhaus.  Because Switzerland remained neutral during World War II, it was able to to continue the exploration of modern graphic design.  After the war, Muller-Brockmann and his colleagues expanded on early modernist design ideas to formulate a strict set of conventions for the use of photomontage and typography within a mathematically based grid layout.  Because Müller-Brockmann taught at the Zurich School of Arts and Crafts (from 1957) and published many books detailing the elements of the Swiss graphic style, what began as a local movement soon grew into an international style whose influence can still be found in contemporary graphic design, particularly in areas of public signage, institutional graphics and corporate identity programs (Vignelli, Chermayeff and Geismar, April Greiman, among others).",,,4,"Swiss, 1914–1996",,18051541,,,,,,Josef Müller-Brockmann,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051541/,,,,,23424957,23424957

"Emery was curator emerita of Technical Studies at the Textile Museum, in Washington, D.C. Although she was trained as a dancer, an illness made her turn to weaving as a therapeutic activity. She taught herself to weave and began studying Navajo and Spanish Colonial textiles. She preferred the American Indian textiles over the more sophisticated work of Europeans and Americans. In 1954, she became a research curator at the Textile Museum and dedicated herself to working in the field of anthropological textile studies.",,,4,"American, 1900–1981",,18045825,,,,,,Irene Emory,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045825/,,,,,23424977,23424977
"Dorothy Wright Liebes’ career began as a school teacher, a practical profession for women in the early 20th century. After some years teaching school, she turned to the arts, something she had always found inspiring. Liebes enrolled in art classes at Berkeley in 1919 and received her B.A. cum laude in Applied Design in 1922. She first pursued her career in what was then the center of the textile industry, New York City, knocking on doors and selling her work to important companies, like Saks Fifth Avenue and Goodall Fabric Company.  
Her marriage to A. H. Liebes Department Store heir, Leon, allowed her the freedom of doing what she wanted, which was to set up her own studio. Inspired by the city’s Chinatown, Dorothy Liebes incorporated red lacquer into her work. She also studied Scandinavian weaving techniques and combined a variety of materials, such as silk, linen, cellophane, and cork. Heavily influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright and his Arts and Crafts movement, Liebes began producing weaves that drew from the natural environment and paid close attention to how light affected those colors’ tones. Liebes traveled to Guatemala in 1936. This 3-month journey gave her new perspective on color and design, and she brought back native motifs with Spanish influences and pre-Columbian textiles. She had cemented her aesthetic, consisting of combining manmade fibers to her textiles along with metallic elements. 
She was named Director of the 1939 Decorative Arts Exhibition in San Francisco, and used this position to turn the world’s attention to craft. As National Director of the Red Cross Arts and Skills Program, she and others trained war veterans to weave giving them a practical skill guaranteeing them jobs in the booming textile industry.
In the 1930s, Hollywood gave Liebes a chance to have a greater impact on American taste, when she was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to design curtains for movie sets. Simultaneously, her hand-woven fabrics were being collected and exhibited at fine art museums, such as the Palace of Fine Arts in San Diego.
By the 1940s, Liebes was approached by companies to evolve her designs into machine-woven textiles. Eventually, she opened her own corporation, Dorothy Liebes Textiles, and began working with many of the leading architecture firms designing and producing patterns and textiles. She continued to travel and is known today to be a pioneer of the textile industry for her innovate use of color and material.",,,163,"American, 1897–1972",,18045817,,,,,,Dorothy Wright Liebes,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045817/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Ethel Stein attended the Hessian Hills School in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, where she was trained in woodworking and painting, sculpture and design (with Joseph Albers). She later took up weaving and began studying the traditional art by researching old textiles at both the Cooper-Hewitt and the Metropolitan. This observation informed her work as an artist, which alternated between geometric abstraction and figurative imagery. She was married to architect Richard Stein.",,,29,"American, b. 1917",,18045887,,,,,,Ethel Stein,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045887/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Born in Fribourg, Switzerland, 22 May 1925, Jean Tinguely is associated with the renewed interest in the DaDa movement in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  From 1941-45, Tinguely studied at the School of Fine Arts in Basel, where he lived until 1952. There he was influenced by the collage constructions of Kurt Schwitters.  At this time he began his interest in movement in art.  After marring Eva Aeppli in 1951, they relocated to Paris where Tinguely worked with Daniel Spoerri in Jean Lurcat's studio on an ""autotheater"" project, which intended to bring action to the stage even in the absence of preformers.  Moving to Dusseldorf in 1959, he made many ""metareliefs""- motorized panels made of moving rods, as well as free standing sculptures.  In one of his early performances pieces, he dropped 150,000 copies of the manifesto Fur Statik from an airplane on Dusseldorf.  In late 1950's an early 1960s he developed the first of the ""painting machines"" which incorporated found, man-made and natural elements.  Concieved as a reaction to the then prevalent Abstract Expressionist style, he helped launch the Nouveau Realisme movement.  After moving  to New York in 1960, he constructd Homage à New York, an elaborate painting machine, in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art, which self destructed.",,,6,"Swiss, 1925 – 1991",,18046537,,,,,,Jean Tinguely,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046537/,,,,,23424957,23424957

"Armitage studied painting at the Chelsea School of Art. She looks to nature for themes, taking her first design “Angelica” from plants that grew along a riverbank in Chiswick as inspiration. Armitage grew up in Kew and loved to go to the Royal Botanic Gardens which she liked to recreate in her elegant wallpapers. She was a Master of the Art Workers’ Guild member. In the 1950s and 60s, when amorphic and abstract designs were popular, Armitage focused on an architectural and bold graphic style. 
After a two-year stay in India, she began linocut printing, producing papers by hand; but soon after, she resigned herself to purchasing a manual offset lithographic printing press. This allowed Armitage to do large scale printing.",,,2,,,18058211,,,,,,Marthe Armitage,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18058211/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"H. Zweigenthal (former name used in Berlin, Germany).  

Notes from visit of 7/1/02, by son Antony Herrey and German architect Thomas Katzke who planning to write a book on H. Herrey:

The architect Hermann Herrey was born in Vienna, Austria (4/4/1904) and died in New York (10/10/1968).  He was in London in 1938, when the Anschlus occured in Austria.  He gave up his Austrian citizenship and made his way to the U.S., ca. 1940*.  Herrey became a naturalized U.S. Citizen in 1946, and was based in New York.

He was not a member of the Baushaus, but knew and worked with Bauhaus architects.  He designed the first high-rise garage in Germany.  The garage still exists, located on Kant Strasse in Berlin.  Among his other works are:  a prefabricated house for the Berlin exhibition ""Das Wachsende Haus;"" a Berlin shoe store; the Arthur Schnitzler House [Architecture Review Supplement (U.K., 1936]; shop interior with built-in glass vitrine in the Jacoby 1872 building, Frankfurt (1929-30); stage/set designs for the London production of Faustus; the Morgenthau house, Long Island; concepts for landfill use in New York (example: Battery Park City).

Re: photos of donor's (Ruth Vollmer) Berlin appartment, showing furniture by Herrey in situ. These were taken by Umbo (photographer's stamp on backs of photos), a bauhaus photographer who documented many Bauhaus designers and architects (Gropius, Mies, others).  (photos are in object file 1982-26-6a,b)

Herrey's papers are in the Crock library at Cornell University.

*note: the boat carrying Herrey's possessions to the U.S. was sunk by a German U-boat.  All of Herrey's things, including many papers and his drawings for the London production of Faustus, went down with the ship.",,,3,"American, 1904–1968",,18049345,,,,,,Hermann Zweigenthal Herrey,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049345/,,,,,23424829,23424829
"Cuban-born, Brooklyn-raised Art Smith was one of the major modernist jewelers of the mid-twentieth century. He attended Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art from 1942 to 1946 where he first pursued architectural studies but eventually abandoned them to concentrate on sculpture and the manipulation of three-dimensional forms. During the early 1940s he learned jewelry making while working part-time as a crafts supervisor at the Children’s Aid Society, and through a night course at New York University. He also worked for and was influenced by Winifred Mason, an African-American jewelry designer with a store in Greenwich Village.  In 1946, Smith opened his first store, also in Greenwich Village. Inspired by surrealism, biomorphism, and primitivism, Smith’s jewelry included large scale, asymmetrical forms made from hand-hammered elements of silver, copper, or brass, sometimes combined with quartz or other colorful stones. His jewelry explored organic shapes and both positive and negative space on several planes. Whatever the form, Smith was continually concerned with the jewelry’s relationship to the human body. He considered his jewelry as an incomplete sculptural expression until it was related to the body. An African-American, he also made reference to his roots through his use of symbols reminiscent of those used in African tribal jewelry.",,,8,"American, 1917–1982",,18049319,,,,,,Art Smith,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18049319/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Hella Jongerius was born in de Meern, The Netherlands in 1963, and graduated from the Academy for Industrial Design in Eindhoven in 1993. In Jongerius’ designs, she often manipulates ancient craft technique and modern technology to yield a product that is of our time. Her early work for Droog Design, the Dutch design collaborative, has been standout in the world of product design for over two decades. At her design firm, Jongeriuslab, materials largely determine the direction of their designs. The range of materials and techniques used at the firm are diverse and very broadly derived. For example, an exploration of polyurethane resulted in Soft Vases (1994), where the form of an antique urn is recast in soft, malleable polyurethane, and, in another project, a primitive wooden African prie-dieu, or prayer desk, is transformed into the Kasese Chair (1999), which couples the elemental nature of felt with futuristic carbon fiber while still preserving the poetry of the original form. Jongerius’ unique approach to design objects, specifically textiles, and her willingness to experiment leads to inspired final products.
Jongerius was also part of Cooper Hewitt's Selects series in 2005.",,,12,"Dutch, b. 1963",,18055675,,,,,,Hella Jongerius,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055675/,,,,,23424909,23424909

"Edward Bawden was a watercolorist, book illustrator, mural painter and designer. In 1925, Bawden saw William Morris's wallpaper ""Daisy"" in an exhibition and was inspired to design his first wallpaper. Harold Curwen saw some of these early designs and wanted to transfer the pieces to his lithographic press so they could be reproduced  and sold. Bawden designed 14 wallpapers between 1926 and 1933 for the Curwen Press. After 1933, Edward Bawden continued to design wallpaper for the English firm, Cole & Sons until the 1950's.",,,21,"English, 1903 – 1989",,18046723,,,,,,Edward Bawden,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046723/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"Paul Rand was born in New York City and studied at Pratt Institute, the Art Student's League and Parsons School of Design. While at the League he studied with George Grosz. Author of ""Thoughts on Design,"" an influential book of design practices published in 1946, Rand incorporates collage and montage techniques to create a dynamic visual / verbal communications vocabulary.  Paul Klee and Wasilly Kandinsky provided a starting point for Rand who adapted formal qualities from their Modernist paintings to his graphic designs.  
Rand was the art director of Esquire  and Apparel Arts magazines from 1937 to 1941 and director of the William H. Weintraub advertising agency where he worked in collaboration with Bill Bernbach on the Orbach's department store campaign. His work with Bernbach is marked by a close association between graphics and copy.  He also contributed covers to the cultural journal Direction from 1938 to 1945.
Rand was design consultant for International Business Machines, Westinghouse and Cummins Engine Co. In 1956 he created the logo for IBM. He also designed the logos for Westinghouse, United Parcel Service and the American Broadcasting Company.
Rand received a gold medal from the American Institute of Graphic Arts, awards from the New York Art Directors Hall of Fame and an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from Philadelphia College of Art. He taught at Pratt, the Cooper Union and Yale University.
Other books by Rand include: Paul Rand: A Designer's Art; The Trademarks of Paul Rand (Wittenborn, 1960); Design and the Play Instinct (G.Braziller, 1965); Advertisement: Ad Vivum or Ad Hominem? (Daedalus, 1960)",,,103,"American, 1914–1996",,18042341,,,,,,Paul Rand,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18042341/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Founded in 1905 as the Star Furniture Company in Zeeland, Michigan, the firm manufactured high quality traditional wood furniture. By 1919, Dirk Jan De Pree, President of the Company, and his father-in-law, Herman Miller, had become majority stock holders in the firm and renamed it for Miller.

During the Great Depression, the company explored new products and manufactured furniture of modern design in order to increase sales. Working with designers such as Gilbert Rohde by the early 1940s, and later with George Nelson, Charles and Ray Eames, and Alexander Girard, the company manufactured a number of pieces that are now considered icons of mid-twentieth-century modernist furniture. The company also focused on producing innovative office furnshings and furniture systems. Herman Miller, Inc. continues today to create cutting-edge and sustainable design for both the home and the workplace.

"Sonia Delaunay (1885–1979) was a modern artist and designer who merged art and everyday life. Her work encompassed everything from paintings and drawings, painted ceramics, and neon light sculpture to posters, textiles, and costume designs. Born in 1885 as Sarah Stern to a Jewish laborer’s family in Gradizhsk, Ukraine, she was adopted at the age of five by her maternal uncle, Henri Terk, a wealthy lawyer in St. Petersburg.  Showing artistic talent in her youth, she attended an art academy in Germany and later went to Paris where she ultimately met her husband, Robert Delaunay, also a painter.  Together they developed the theory of Simultaneity, which is the sensation of movement when placing contrasting colors side by side, and is very much expressed in their paintings as well as in the textiles that Sonia Delaunay designed in the 1920s.",,,2,"French, b.

"Ladislav Sutnar, a Bohemian painter and an advertising, display, and industrial designer, was an innovator in the field of information design and information graphics. Sutnar was known for his ability to communicate complex information with clarity, most notably for Sweet’s Catalog Service and in publications including Design for Point of Sale (1952), Package Design: The Force of Visual Selling (1953), and Visual Design in Action: Principles, Purposes (1961). His graphic design vocabulary, based on Constructivism and geometry, employed functional typography, limited color palettes, and layout frameworks to facilitate searching, scanning, and reading. Sutnar was also one of the most notable industrial and exhibition designers of the 1930s. His most important industrial designs of that era include a glass drinking set (1930-1932), a china table set (1928-1932), and cutlery. Sutnar’s designs for heat-resistant glass cups, tea sets, and containers (1931), produced by Schöne Stube in Prague, were among the first applications of the material for home use. 

Sutnar immigrated to the United States in 1939, shortly after arriving for the New York World’s Fair as the chief designer of the Czechoslovak Hall in the Czech pavilion. Sutnar subsequently embarked upon a prolific career in typography, packaging, advertising and exhibition design. From 1941 to 1960, he was the art director, coordinator and designer for F.W. Dodge’s Sweet’s Catalog Service, a company that produced annually-updated catalogs of industrial and architectural products. In 1960, after leaving Sweet’s, Sutnar began a series of “Venus” paintings and prints, which featured prototypes of American woman in executed in a flat, graphic style with bold colors. 

Sutnar concurrently studied painting at the School of Applied Arts, mathematics at the Czech Technical University and architecture at Charles University, in Prague. He later taught design at the State School for Graphic Arts in Prague, In the United States, Sutnar also served as the art director of Theatre Arts Magazine. Sutnar won a gold medal for exhibition design at the 1929 Exposition Internacional de Barcelona, grand prize for exhibition design at the 1936 Triennale di Milano, and fourteen grand prizes and gold medals for exhibition design at the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. Sutnar was elected an honorary member of the Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences in America in 1970, a hall of fame member of the Art Directors Club in 1979, and was awarded the AIGA gold medal in 1995. Sutnar died at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City on November 18, 1976.",,,52,"American and Czech, b. Pilsen, Bohemia, 1897, d.

With his father and his brother Johann Israel, he published two popular emblem books: Emblemata nobilitate et vulgo scitu digna (Frankfurt am Main, 1593; Paris, 1895) and Emblemata secularia (Oppenheim, 1611). With his brother he also published the design of a grotesque and quasi-erotic human alphabet (Hollstein, nos 119–69). His independent work includes reproductive engravings after such masters as Titian, Marten de Vos, Abraham Bloemaert and Sebald Beham.

"Dorothy Draper was an interior decorator who wrote the 1939 book, Decorating is Fun! How to be Your Own Decorator. She came from a wealthy family and married Dr. George Draper, who became Franklin D. Roosevelt’s person doctor. Although she was not schooled, she was educated by her wealthy surroundings. Draper is best known for creating the Modern Baroque style, which uses bright colors, bold prints, and a modern take on classical styles. In 1918, Draper decorated her own home, and after receiving many compliments and encouragements, she decided to launch a career out of her passion. In 1925, she opened the Architectural Clearing House. Consequently, she was commissioned to redecorate the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan, the Fairmont and the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco, and later came other important hotels all over the country.",,,2,"American, 1889–1969",,18043555,,,,,,Dorothy Draper,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043555/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Alexander Girard (1907-93) was one of the leading American designers during the mid-20th century and was a strong proponent, along with his colleagues Eero Saarinen, Charles and Ray Eames, Kevin Roche and George Nelson, for bringing an affordable modernism to the middle class. The designs that resulted from these collaborations now define 1950s and 60s modernism in America. Educated as an architect at the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Royal School of Architecture in Rome, he came to the United States in 1932 to set up an architecture and interior design office in New York. Girard was the head of the Textile Division of Herman Miller Inc. from 1952 to 1973. During this time, Girard created over three hundred designs for textiles coordinated for use as upholstery fabrics, draperies and casement goods for private and commercial interiors, exhibitions and corporate identity programs. His exuberant use of color, texture and pattern drew from folk art and Op art influences, synthesized into a unique style which became “the look” of 1960s America. Ultimately settling in Santa Fe, New Mexico he continued to practice as a “designer” in the all-inclusive sense of the word, by designing residences, exhibitions, company identities, furniture and textiles throughout the duration of his career.",,,1274,"American, 1907–1993",,18046041,,,,,,Alexander Hayden Girard,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046041/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Frances Butler began as a printer of fabrics, printing calligraphy on fabric in 1965. In the beginning, she was interested in blending several art media, such as stretching a sewn fabric over metal structure and then painting it. Butler designed in several different media: posters, silkscreening and applique dressmaking. She was extremely experimental. When Butler tired of applique dressmaking, she began printing and airbrushing fabric for her dresses. Eventually she turned to the market and created functional products with her printed fabrics, such as comforters and tablecloths with printed words and images, and printed collapsible tea tables. In 1973, she launched a fabric printing company called Goodstuffs, which produced fabric graphics, wall hangings, and other products which were sold to J.C. Penney’s and Macy’s. Butler launched a publishing press called Poltroon Press for which she produced book illustrations and wall designs. With both companies, located in Emeryville, CA, she was able to produce different merchandise for interiors and households.",,,12,"American, b. 1940",,18046019,,,,,,Frances Butler,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046019/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"1n 1997, Bowness graduated from Leeds College of Art & Design, where she studied surface pattern and textile design; then received her MA from the Royal College of Art in constructed textiles. Wanting her art to be functional, Bowness introduced a different approach to art. For her first wallpaper, she photographed hanging dresses and made a montage of them, then made lifesized digital prints, adding colorful silkscreened details. Her other famous work is the “Genuine Fake Bookshelf,” which she produced in 2002. It depicts life-size bookshelves filled with books. Bowness has been commissioned by major brands, such as Polydor, Lacroix, and Reebok. She designs some of her work in St. Leonards, on the southern coast of England; her factory is located near York, north England.",,,1,,,18060627,,,,,,Deborah Bowness,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18060627/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"Thomas Demand is an internationally known photographer from Germany who has a unique approach to his work. Although the imagery in his photographs appears to be real, it is actually a recreation of a scene using torn paper and cardboard. Demand usually works with an image culled from the media and then reconstructs the scene in a life-size three-dimensional format. His reconstructions are very detailed—he even simulates the texture of the source materials. Demand’s work challenges the notion of photography as being an unbiased glimpse of reality. Things are not what they seem in Demand’s work. After the model is photographed, the paper and cardboard is destroyed.

Demand studied at the Staatliche Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf and at Goldsmiths College in London. He originally studied sculpture and later pursued photography. In 1993, he began joining these two media by constructing the scenes he wished to photograph. Many of the images Demand chooses to recreate and capture in his photographs are of violent or grim situations. Acts of violence, however, are absent. The images may initially appear innocent, but there is usually a darker side. Demand’s photographs are held by museum collections including the Guggenheim, the Tate Gallery and the Carnegie Museum of Art",,,1,,,18061213,,,,,,Thomas Demand,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18061213/,,,,,23424829,23424829

"Born in Willisau in 1947, Niklaus Troxler has pursued his passions for jazz and graphic design since he was a teenager. He organized his first jazz concert when he was 19 and also grew interested in posters by Herbert Leupin and other Swiss graphic designers. After apprenticing as a typographer (1963–67), he studied graphic at the Art School of Lucerne (1967–71). Following graduation, Troxler worked in Paris as art director for Hollenstein Création (1971–72) before returning to Willisau, where he started his own design firm in 1973. Two years later, Troxler launched the first Willisau Jazz Festival. Along the way, Troxler has received prizes in poster competitions in Europe, Russia, and China, including a special award from the Art Directors Club of Switzerland.

"nendo is a multidisciplinary design and architecture group co-founded in 2002 in Tokyo by Akihiro Ito, who is the managing director, and Oki Sato (b. 1977), the chief designer.  nendo, whose name is a reference to modeling clay used by children, considers its mission to be “giving people a small ""!"" moment.”  Sato and his team take their inspiration from observing daily life and being attentive to both the subtle and the strange.  nendo’s aesthetic is simple and minimal, but not cold—they strive to evoke lightness and humor in each of their designs.  nendo was included in the 2010 National Design Triennial ""Why Design Now?"" at Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum.  Works by the design firm can be found in the collections of the Cooper-Hewitt, as well as The Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Musée des Arts décoratifs, Paris, among many others.  nendo was named 2012 “Designer of the Year” in Wallpaper magazine.",,,3,,,18062367,,,,,,"nendo (Japanese, 2002-)",,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18062367/,,,,,23424856,23424856
"Born in Paris, Lacroix was brought to Rome as a young boy with his mother who was a lady in waiting to Queen Hortense of Holland.  His childhood was spent in the close circle of Queen Hortense and her son Prince Louis Napoleon (later Napoleon III).  Lacroix studied architecture in Paris under Simon Claude Constant-Dufeux and as the watercolor's dedication suggests, this relationship began under more informal terms in Rome.  Lacroix received considerable professional appointments under the Second Empire, including head architect in charge of the renovation of the Élysée Place and designer of several tombs for the Bonaparte family.  Much is written about Eugène's sister, Hortense Cornu (1809-1875), who was a writer, translator, and frequent correspondent with and confidant of Napoleon III.

"Preston Scott Cohen received his BFA and BArch from the Rhode Island School of Design (1982–83) and his MArch from the Harvard University Graduate School of Design (1985). In addition to a private practice, he is the Gerald M. McCue Professor of Architecture at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, where he also serves as the director of the Master of Architecture degree programs. He has a long record of publications, which have appeared in architectural journals like Architectural Design, Architecture and Urbanism, AA Files, Assemblage, and Domus. He is the author of Contested Symmetries and Other Predicaments in Architecture (2001). 

Cohen's work has been critically-acclaimed since the early 1990s. He was a winner of the 1992 Architectural League of New York’s Young Architects Forum. In 1996, Scott Cohen was one of four architects who represented the United States in the Emerging Voices exhibition at the Venice Biennale International Exhibition of Architecture. In 1998 and 2000, he received the Progressive Architecture Award from Architecture magazine. Cohen’s work was first brought to public attention through MoMA’s 1999 exhibition, The Un-private House, in which his “Torus” Wolf House was one of the more interesting and most frequently reproduced projects in this show. His projects have been included in many group exhibitions.

Critics cite geometry and biology as Cohen’s main sources of inspiration. K. Michael Hays writes that “Cohen’s particular use of (and even obsession with) projective geometry as a specifically demarcated set of codes and procedures that, when used in ways initiated and developed in architecture’s own disciplinary history, conserves and extends this particular field of activity.”[1]

"Finnish fabric manufacturer and retail chain. The company's chief designer was Armi Ratia (1912-1979), who was known for her use of vibrant colors and large patterns. She first joined her husband's design firm, Printex, in 1949. In 1951, the company was renamed Marimekko, which means ""a little dress for Mary"" in Finnish. During the 1960s and '70s, the firm manufactured cotton, jersey, and wool fabrications, along with paper, laminated plastics, and table coverings. Ratia was known for designing free, easy fashions in bold painterly designs taking much of her inspiration from nature and handicraft. Ben Thompson, the founder of the retail establishment Design Research, Inc. (D/R), discovered Ratia's designs at the Finnish Pavilion of the Brussels Worlds Fair in 1957, and persuaded her to come to the United States. D/R became the exclusive representative of Marimekko products in women and children, as well as household accessories and furniture.",,,29,"Helsinki, Finland, founded 1951",,18045663,,,,,,Marimekko Oy,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045663/,,,,,23424812,23424812

"The self-taught textile artist emigrated from Budapest to New York City at the age of 16. She began as a clothing designer for women and children. After World War II, Americans began looking toward more folk and local aesthetics, such as Western and Native American motifs. With Karasz’s interest in her native Hungarian folk traditions, she began creating embroidered wall hangings in that manner. The new “Made in America” mentality that developed after the war also encouraged many crafts people to revive the art. 
After a successful book, “Adventures in Stitches: A New Art of Embroidery,” published in 1949, Karasz went on to guest edit at House Beautiful and is credited as reviving domestic embroidery in the 1950s.",,,40,1898–1960,,18045635,,,,,,Mariska Karasz,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045635/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Junichi Arai, an important innovator in 20th century textiles, was born in 1932 in Kiryu, a city that has been an important center for textile production in Japan for four centuries. As the sixth generation of a mill-owning family, Arai grew up with fabrics being woven for obis and kimonos. He maintains a deep reverence for traditional weaving techniques and the capabilities that only the hand can provide in the craft of making fabrics. In 1984 he founded Nuno Corporation, a company and retail store that produces and sells innovative functional fabrics. Though his work is very technically innovative, Arai takes a traditional approach with his company by employing local craftspeople to help create his work. He has expanded the potential of a jacquard loom, explored reflective surfaces using polyester slit yarn, developed new interpretations of age-old techniques such as ikat and shibori (tie-dye), and exploited the thermoplastic memories of synthetic fibers to give flat fabrics and third dimension. Because of his extensive work, Arai holds patents on 36 processes.",,,30,"Japanese, b. 1932",,18045617,,,,,,Junichi Arai,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045617/,,,,,23424856,23424856

"Diane Itter began experimenting with fiber in 1968. She graduated with an MFA in textiles from Indiana University in 1974. She also studied at the University of Pittsburgh, experimenting with hand-tied knots instead of loom-woven fabrics. Itter set tools aside in order to focus on the material itself. She chose to concentrate solely on one technique and one material—the double half-hitch knot and linen thread. Itter was inspired by pre-Columbian Peruvian cloth, and later incorporated elements of African, Amish and Native American textiles. Before her death, she looked to Asian influences, such as kimono and tunic formats.",,,1,1946–1989,,18045633,,,,,,Diane Itter,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18045633/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Lanette Scheeline was born in 1910 in Northen California. She graduated from the College of Fine Arts at the University of California at Berkeley in 1932. She also took a textile design course at UCLA and a year of course work at the Rudolph Schaeffer School of Design in San Francisco. After teaching art for one year, Scheeline began to work for Louma Prints, a textile silkscreen factory in San Francisco. Her work with Louma was cut short by WWII, when she moved to Marin county, to work in a shipyard. After two years of war she established her own design studio in Mill Valley, CA.
It is after 1945 that she designed the wallpaper. She met William Katzenbach, the primary partner for the New York based wallpaper firm Katzenbach and Warren, described in Interiors Magazine of April 1955 as ""Consistently avant-garde in both design and technical innovations"". Around 1955 Lanette Scheeline produced a new type of mural decoration for Katzenbach, the ""Tree"" series.

"Founded in 1880 by Maria Longworth Nichols, Rookwood produced appealing vases, hand-decorated by a diverse group of talented artists. There were 20-25 artists decorating pieces at any given time. Many were innovative as well as talented. In the early 1900s, Rookwood began using matte finishes and vellum glaze, a translucent matte glaze. Rookwood filed for bankruptcy in 1941 and, although it did reorganize, it was repeatedly sold and finally shut down in the 1960s. In 1886, Rookwood began using the insignia--a backwards R with a P, and subsequently added a flame around the letters, adding a flame each year to indicate the date the piece was produced. Stating in 1900, the year of production is indicated in Roman numerals; besides the factory insignia and the date, there is a decorator's insignia, and often a clay or body mark and a size mark (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",,,42,"Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, founded 1880",,18043903,,,,,,Rookwood Pottery,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043903/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Beatrice Wood studied painting at the Académie Julien and acting at the Comédie Francaise. She lived in New York and befriended many of the great artists of the 20th century, including Man Ray, Francis Picabia, and Charles Sheeler, among others. Dubbed “the Mama of Dada,” she and Man Ray co-founded the magazine, Blind Man, which was one of the earliest manifestations of Dada art in New York. Beatrice did not encounter ceramics until the 1930s when she enrolled in a pottery course at Hollywood High School. It wasn’t until 1940 when she studied with ceramicists Gertrud and Otto Naztler that she began appreciating ceramics in a new way. In 1948, she settled in Ojai, CA and created ceramic figurines, decorative vessels and dinner sets which supported her throughout her career.",,,7,"American, 1894–1998",,18043979,,,,,,Beatrice Wood,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043979/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"University City Pottery was a division of the Art Institute at University City in Missouri.  It was promoted by Edward Garner Lewis who began the American Woman's League in 1907, whose purpose was to develop ""the integrity and purity of the American home, with wider opportunity for American women.""  The Art Institute was more developed than the other schools of education, language, commerce, administration, journalism and photography.  The Art Insitute had a prestigious faculty:  George Julian Zolnay, the sculptor, was Dean and Director; John H. Vanderpoel, Director of the School of Painting; Antoinette P. Taylor, instructor of metal and leather work; Mrs. Prudence Stokes Brown, instructor of elementary handiwork; Taxile Doat, Director of the School of Ceramic Art.  
Working with Taxile Doat in ceramics: Frederick Hurten Rhead of Rhead Pottery, instructor of pottery; Mrs. Adelaide Alsop Robineau of Robineau Pottery; Mrs. Kathryn E. Cherry, Instructor of China Painting and Ceramic Design; Edward Dahlquist of Shawsheen Pottery, instructor of built pottery; Frank J. Fuhrmann, instructor of throwing and turning pottery; Eugene Labarriere and Emile Diffloth both associates of Doat's from Europe.   
The experiments of this knowledgeable group proved that native United States clays were superior to the finest of Europe and were more widely available.  The Grand Prize awarded to the University City Pottery in Turin, Italy, at the International Exposition in 1911 further emphasized that this American pottery could compete with the best of Europe.  The pottery was noted for its superior bodies, matt and gloss glazes, colored and colorless, all of the matt greens of various textures, alligator skin, crystalline, Oriental crackle, and a matt white.  These were accomplished by glazes with the coloring oxides thoroughly incorporated and then fired at the same temperature as the body. 
Frederick Hurten Rhead and Mr. and Mrs. Robineau left the pottery in 1911, as well as the break up of the American Women's League occurred at this time.  After a reorganization under Doat, in 1912, the pottery continued to produce excellent work with the ending of production by early 1915.

"The Rosenthal firm was founded in the 1890s by Philip Rosenthal, Sr., who lived in the United States for about a decade before returning to his native Germany. From its earliest days, Rosenthal exported its products to the United States, where the company enjoyed strong sales. By the late 1920s, the company had its own import subsidiaries in the United States: the Rosenthal China Corporation and the Continental Ceramics Corporation, both with offices in New York. Among its innovative marketing at the time, the firm sold its wares in shops that exclusively offered Rosenthal; they also developed the idea of “open stock” so that consumers could buy individual pieces rather than full sets. Nazi-era management relinquished control of the firm in the late 1940s. By 1950, Philip Rosenthal, Jr. had taken over the business.",,,17,,,18044069,,,,,,Rosenthal Aktiengesellschaft,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044069/,,,,,23424829,23424829

"John Foster’s passion for art started early in his hometown of Detroit. He studied drawing under John Wicker at the Wicker School of Fine Arts before attending the University of Michigan. From 1922 to 1944, Foster worked at the Ford Motor Company and was made Chief Ceramic Engineer at the Ford River Rouge Plant. After 1938, Foster was in charge of pottery at Greenfield Village. He began making pottery and firing it alongside spark plug molds. He became an admirer of the work of the Arts and Crafts ceramicist, Adelaide Alsop Robineau, and began studying pottery with a focus on crystalline glazes, for which he is best known today. 

Foster first exhibited his work in 1934 at the third annual Robineau Memorial Exhibition, a national show held at the Syracuse Museum of Art. His work was exhibited extensively at Syracuse and at the Michigan Artist-Craftsman exhibitions held at the Detroit Institute of Arts. His striped bowls were awarded the Georg Jensen Prize at the Designer Craftsmen U.S.A. exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum in 1953. Foster was invited to attend the International Conference of Craftsmen in Pottery and Textiles at Dartington Hall, Devon, England, in 1952, and gave a talk on Festival Ware (a dinnerware designed by Foster and produced in his studio.) His Festival Ware was awarded the Founders Purchase prize at the 1952 Exhibition for Michigan Artist-Craftsmen, and was exhibited at the 1958 Brussels World’s Fair. Foster organized the Michigan Potters’ Association in 1958, and served as representative to the North Central Regional Assembly of the American Craftsmen Council from 1959 to 1963.

Foster’s pottery is a celebration of his artistic and engineering capabilities. His early works were quite small and elegant in classical Chinese style. As his career progressed, Foster’s works became more deliberate in pattern. The shapes are reminiscent of natural forms with a sense of motion and movement. Though all the pots do not bear a name, they all are instilled with a sense of meaning. The artist even wrote extensive notes about each piece. He felt his works were “a considered statement about life and living.”[1]

Foster was an influential teacher, provoking his students, colleagues, and followers to think about larger artistic concepts when working in clay. “John Foster’s pottery is a unique example of the combination of ceramic excellence with spiritual sensitivity.”[2]

"Ohr was born in Biloxi, Mississippi, on July 12, 1857.  The self-styled “mad potter of Biloxi” is known especially for his unique ability to create very thin-walled vases on a potter’s wheel and his various techniques for distorting a piece’s shape—e.g., twisting the vase to make an undulating pattern, flattening the opening in segments to get a pie crust effect, pinching the rim and bending it in a bunched ribbon effect, etc.  In 1881-2, starting in New Orleans, Ohr hopped on freight trains and stopped in 16 states to visit every potter he could find.  In 1883, in Biloxi, he built his first pottery. A prolific worker, he is said to have created over 10,000 pots in his lifetime.

"Vivianna Torun Bülow-Hube is one of Sweden’s most important 20th century silversmiths and jewelers. She is the first female silversmith to become internationally famous. Torun, as she was known, attended the Stockholm University of Arts, Crafts and Design and soon after opened her own studio, becoming the first female silversmith with a private workshop in Sweden.  Torun was active in Sweden, France, Germany and Indonesia. She produced jewelry, watches, and tableware for many celebrities, including Ingrid Bergman and Pablo Picasso, among others. Some of her pieces became world-renown for their revolutionary design. For example, “Mobius,” a necklace with a crystal drop was to be draped over the shoulder; her bangle-style wristwatch became the first watch ever to be produced by Georg Jensen.
Her innovative designs earned her several awards throughout her career.",,,21,"Swedish, 1927–2004",,18044009,,,,,,Vivianna Torun Bülow-Hübe,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044009/,,,,,23424954,23424954

"Josef Lobmeyr (1792-1855) founded his glassware company in Vienna in 1822. Lobmeyr opened a ""glass wares"" store, selling products of different manufacturers and serving as Viennese representative of the most important Bohemian glass factories, such as Joseph Loetz. By 1840, Lobmeyr began to design and produce his own glassware as well, primarily Biedermeier table glasses and decanters, combining classic design with innovative manufacturing and glassmaking technologies. The firm's glasses favored utility and a clarity of forms that helped to influence the modern aesthetic. Its initial success was furthered in the era of Ludwig (II) Lobmeyr, nephew of Josef, a successful entrepreneur who understood the importance of having recognized designers and artists design for the firm--which it continues to do today. By then known as J. & L. Lobmeyr, it exhibited at the 1862 International Exposition in London, where it was awarded a gold medal as a glass refiner ""for excellence in the making of crystal glass, tableware, and candelabra."" The firm also showed at the 1873 World Exhibition in Vienna in the working room of the emperor. (Ludwig Lobmeyr served as purveyor of glass and glassware to the Austrian imperial court starting in 1860.) 

J. & L. Lobmeyr continued to exhibit at important international exhibitions throughout the nineteenth and into the twentieth century, such as Paris in 1925 and the 1939 New York World's Fair. The firm's commitment to design from the artistic heritage of Ludwig Lobmeyr and Josef Storck led to the commissioning of artists from the Wiener Werkstatte, including pieces by Josef Hoffmann, Adolf Loos, Stefan and Marianne Rath, Josef Winner, and Michael Powolny. In the late twentieth century, Lobmeyr revived its practice of working with outside designers, including renowned American designer Ted Muehling.

The firm continues to produce elegant and prized glasswares today under the leadership of the same family that founded it nearly two centuries ago.",,,160,"Vienna, Austria, founded ca. 1935",,18061841,,,,,,J. & L.

"Thomas Eyck is a self-proclaimed “design publisher.” The centerpiece of Eyck’s career is his fascination with materials, an interest he gained after years in the design world. Eyck received his M.A. in Art and Design from the University of Utrecht in 1991 and served on the Board of Management at ceramics manufactory Royal Tichelaar Makkum for almost seven years. Since founding a design firm that bears his name in 2007, Eyck has established a growing collection of products by a hand-selected contingent of Dutch designers. Before he selects the designers, Eyck chooses one specific material to shape the identity of the design. He then mediates the relationship between designer and manufacturer, manipulating the design process to investigate each material’s potential. Eyck’s list of collaborators includes Hella Jongerius, Irma Boom, RaR, Studio Job and Aldo Bakker. Eyck also works as a curatorial consultant at the Zuiderzeemuseum in Enkhuiszen, Netherlands.

"As a fashion designer, Helmut Lang is associated with the pared-down, urban aesthetic of the 1990s. He is considered a part of the mid-1990s minimalist fashion movement. He is also known for introducing a new aesthetic to menswear, for which he won the CFDA Award for Menswear Designer of the Year in 2000. Lang's cerebral approach and sometimes esoteric references never interfered with his ability to produce commercially successful and highly wearable garments. 

Olivier Saillard, curator at the Musée de la Mode et du Textile in Paris, writes, ""Lang has reconciled a commercial fashion audience with a highly personal and discreet approach, but one that does not fall into the trap of excessive intellectualizing that sometimes transforms women into an abstraction. He also helped launch a practical uniform for the city whose pants, like a long-legged second skin, have surely contributed to the elastic silhouette that has become part of the 2000s.""

Lang opened his first studio in Vienna in 1977 and relocated to New York in the late 1990s. He was the first New York based designer to show his fall collection before the Paris and Milan shows and is credited with the eventual scheduling shift of New York fashion week to a month in advance of the European shows. In 1999, Prada Group purchased a majority stake in the Helmut Lang company. Lang left the fashion world in 2005, citing a desire for new challenges.",,,1,"Austrian, born 1956",,18063011,,,,,,Helmut Lang,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18063011/,,,,,23424750,23424750

"Born in 1952 in Dumbarton, Scotland, David Byrne is a well-known musician and a founding member of the band “Talking Heads.” His work has won Grammy, Oscar, and Golden Globe awards, and he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Living in the United States since childhood, he briefly attended the Rhode Island School of Design. He dropped out to form a band, eventually founding “Talking Heads” in 1975. After performing in New York clubs for two years, the band had gained extreme popularity by 1977. In addition to his success as a member of Talking Heads—which broke up in 1991—Byrne has also enjoyed a career as a solo performer. He has worked in film—including the music for The Last Emperor, which won an Oscar for Best Original Score—and theatre. He has founded an independent record label, Todo Mundo. In 1987, he was married to the costume designer Adelle Lutz, with whom he had a daughter, Malu Abeni Valentine Byrne.

"Judith Brown is best known for her figural sculptures. Born in New York City, she attended Sarah Lawrence College, where she studied sculpture under Abstract Expressionist Theodore Roszak. From him, Brown learned how to weld. She opened a studio in Reading, Vermont, where she would collect scrap metal to use in her objects. Brown loved dance, and had been a dancer herself, so when she created her figures, they usually embraced the motion and immediacy of a dancer’s body.  During her travels throughout Europe, Brown sketched Classical and Renaissance works.  She was commissioned to design window displays for a variety of different stores, including Tiffany & Co. Throughout her career Brown exhibited widely and received several awards for her innovative designs.",,,1,"American, 1931–1992",,18050115,,,,,,Judith Brown,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18050115/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Alvaro Siza is among today’s greatest living architects. Siza, whose full name is Alvaro Joaquim de Meio Siza Vieira, was born in 1933 in Matosinhos, a small coastal town in an impoverished region of northern Portugal. He studied from 1949 to 1955 at the University of Porto School of Architecture in Oporto, before opening his own firm in 1955. He taught at the School of Architecture from 1966 and, in 1976 was made a professor of architecture. Siza has also been a visiting professor at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, the University of Pennsylvania, the Universidad de Los Andes in Bogatá, Colombia, and the École Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne, France, in addition to guest lectureships at universities all over the world.

Siza was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize for lifetime achievement in 1992. In 1988, the Harvard University Graduate School of Design presented him with the Prince of Wales Prize in Urban Design for his housing project in Evora, Portugal. That same year, Siza also received the European Economic Community’s Mies Van der Rohe Prize. In 1986, he was awarded the honorary title of Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. 

Siza’s work covers the full range of structures from mass housing developments to individual residences, banks, office buildings, art museums, restaurants, and a spectrum of building types in between. Siza brings a unique sensitivity to space and time, as well as a special quality of light as an expressive medium, to all of his projects. His work builds upon and extends the European modernist tradition of Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier that governed the architectural field from 1920 to 1970. His respect for context, for national traditions, and for contemporary needs, takes his architecture beyond the limitations of historical modernism.",,,1,b. 1933,,18056509,,,,,,Alvaro Joaquim de Meio Siza Vieira,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18056509/,,,,,23424925,23424925

"Bill Moggridge was the fourth director of Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum (2010-12) and an outspoken advocate for the value of design in everyday life. Designer of the first laptop computer and co-founder of the renowned innovation and design firm, IDEO, Bill pioneered interaction design and integrated human factors into the design of computer software and hardware.

As Cooper Hewitt’s director, Bill worked to establish the museum as the nation’s preeminent design resource. He enhanced its profile as one of the world’s leading authorities on the integral role of design in daily life, and developed and presented exhibitions—both real and virtual.

Bill joined Cooper Hewitt at a critical juncture, when the museum was in the midst of the largest capital improvement program in its history. Under Bill’s leadership, Phase One of the renovation project, involving work on the museum’s two townhouses, was completed in 2011 and included the new National Design Library, an additional classroom, administrative and curatorial offices, and a new staff and public entrance from 9 East 90th Street. 

Bill was a Royal Designer for Industry, a 2010 winner of the Prince Philip Designers Prize, and a 2009 winner of Cooper Hewitt’s National Design Award for Lifetime Achievement. He described his career as having three phases: first, as a designer; second, as a leader of design teams and; third, as a communicator. For the two decades he spent as a designer, Bill developed high-tech products for clients in ten countries. It was during this phase, in 1982, that he designed the GRiD Compass, which is also known as the first laptop computer. When Bill co-founded IDEO in 1991, with David Kelley and Mike Nuttall, he built client relationships with multinational companies and turned his focus to developing best practices for interdisciplinary teams. Beginning in 2000, he began actively promoting his views on the importance of design in everyday life through writing books, producing videos, giving presentations, and teaching. When he came to Cooper Hewitt, the museum was able to support his outreach through the historical depth and contemporary reach of its collections and initiatives.

A graduate of the Central School of Design in London, Bill’s professional activities included those of advisor to the British government on design education (1974), trustee of the Design Museum in London (1992-1995), visiting professor in interaction design at the Royal College of Art in London (1993), and member of the Steering Committee for the Interaction Design Institute in Ivrea, Italy (2003). He was the author of Designing Media (2010), which examines the connections between traditional media and the emerging digital realm, and Designing Interactions (2006), which explores how interaction design transforms daily life.",,,7,"English, 1943–2012",,18062553,,,,,,Bill Moggridge,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18062553/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"Although Wim Crouwel trained as a painter at the Academie Minerva (1947–49) in his hometown of Groningen and at the Kunstnijverheids Onderwijs in Amsterdam (1950–52), he rapidly gravitated to the field graphic design field, establishing his own firm in 1954. A major turning point in his professional development came when he met the Swiss-trained designers, Karl Gerstner, Gérard Ifert, and Ernst Scheidegger, who impressed him with their rationalized design and typography, particularly the sans serif font Akzidenz Grotesk, a forerunner to Helvetica. From the Swiss model, Crouwel adopted the practice of the grid as a way of creating visual order. He later acquired from his colleagues the nickname “Gridnik.” 

Crowel’s big break came in 1956 when Edy de Wilde, then director of the Van Abbemuseum, gave him an initial graphic design commission that resulted in a regular partnership with Crouwel to design all of the museum’s printed material. This client/designer relationship continued after de Wilde transferred as director to the Stedelijk Museum in 1963. For Crouwel, de Wilde was an ideal client who allowed him the freedom to experiment and create new fonts, which he would then use in his designs. Beginning in 1971, Crouwel also provided graphic materials for the Museum Fodor (now Fotografiemuseum Amsterdam).

While working on museum commissions, Crouwel started a partnership with the Indonesian industrial designer Kho Liang Ie (1956–60). The Kho-Crouwel design style has been described as a fusion of Asian poetry with rational thinking. The firm received attention and acclaim for their work for Stichting Goed Wonen, de Bijenkorf, Auping, and Linoleum Krommenie.

In the early 1960s, a series of discussions took place in the Netherlands and England about the need to create a multidisciplinary firm in the Netherlands similar to those already established in the United States and in England that could service a variety of commissions including industrial design, interior architecture, and graphic design. These dialogues, which included Crouwel and other Dutch designers, resulted in the creation of the Associatie voor Total Design NV. The aim of Total Design was to develop and execute design ideas in all fields, based on a single vision, of which standardization was a foundational element. This extended to paper format, typeface, pattern, and word spacing. This approach easily fit the needs of the corporate world, and clients included IBM, various Dutch banks, the cities of Groningen and Rotterdam, and several cultural institutions. As the partnership in Total Design began to dissolve in the late 1960s, Crouwel cut back on his involvement but stayed on as an advisor. He began teaching at the Delft University of Technology (1971), where he served as dean of the industrial design department (1983–85). Crouwel became director of the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1985–93), during which time he also taught at Erasmus University Rotterdam as associate professor of art and cultural sciences.

When Crouwel was asked if design was pure problem solving or whether there was also room for personal expression, he responded, “Of course design is about problem solving, but I cannot resist adding something personal. A page should have tension.”

Crouwel’s contribution to graphic design went largely unnoticed in the United States until the confluence of two events: the wide distribution of the film Helvetica (2007), in which he is interviewed, and his 80th birthday in 2008 that occasioned several exhibitions in the Netherlands and in the United States.",,,1,"Dutch, b. 1928",,18062597,,,,,,Wim Crouwel,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18062597/,,,,,23424909,23424909

"Brian Connelly (1926-63) is a self-taught American artist.  Little is known about Connelly, but in the late 1940s or early 1950s he became involved with Associated American Artists (AAA), a profitable gallery and organization that was founded in 1934 by Reeves Lewenthal.  Lewenthal and AAA played a central role in “linking modern American art and consumerism” by producing limited edition fine art prints by American artists such as Connelly as well as more famous names as Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood.",,,1,"American, 1926 - 1962",,18055323,,,,,,Brian Connelly,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055323/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"The Danish furniture and interior designer Finn Juhl, with Klaare Klint and Arne Jacobson, made Denmark a leader in modern home furnishings in the 1940s and 1950s. Juhl, in particular, led the fashion for Danish modern domestic furniture in the American market during the 1950s and 1960s.

Juhl trained in architecture at the Academy of Arts in Copenhagen. He graduated in 1934 and spent the first 10 years of his career working in the architecture offices of Vihelm Lauritzsen in Copenhagen. He made his debut as a furniture designer at the Copenhagen Cabinetmakers’ Guild exhibition at the Museum of Decorative Arts in 1937. Considered highly controversial in the 1930s and 1940s, Juhl’s furniture broke with the tradition of pared-down, historicist furniture forms popularized by Klint, who then dominated furniture design. Instead, Juhl experimented during the 1940s with new forms and production methods in collaboration with the highly skilled cabinetmaker, Niels Vodder. In 1945, Juhl introduced his characteristic chair form and construction at the Cabinetmakers’ Guild exhibition. The 45chair, as it came to be known, featured a one-piece curving seat and back that was separate from the sculpted teak wood frame, conveying the feeling of incomparable weightlessness. Working through the 1940s and 1950s with this kind of construction, Juhl and Vodder together produced a series of organic chairs, sofas, and tables that won 14 prizes from the Copenhagen Cabinetmakers’ Guild as well as six Milan Triennale gold medals. All the furniture was custom-made in limited quantities.

Juhl’s introduction to the American market began in 1948 when MoMA’s managing director of the design department, Edgar Kaufmann Jr. commissioned him to design MoMA’s second Good Design exhibition. An article on Juhl by Kaufmann for Interiors magazine caught the attention of the president of Baker Furniture Incorporated, Hollis Baker, who was interested in introducing a modern furniture line with Juhl’s designs. After meeting with Juhl in Copenhagen and in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a contract was signed in September 1950, according to which Baker would mass produce some of the models already fabricated in limited quantities by Vodder, as well as new models especially suited to the American market. The Baker line, known as Baker Modern, was introduced in June 1951. Altogether, Baker manufactured 24 of Juhl’s furniture models, including side chairs, armchairs, sofas, desks, coffee tables, sideboards, and night stands.",,,2,"Danish, 1912 – 1989",,18055329,,,,,,Finn Juhl,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18055329/,,,,,23424796,23424796

"The Deerfield Society of Blue and White Needlework was founded in Deerfield, Massachusets in 1896 and closed in 1926. The founders were Margaret Whiting (1869–1946) and Ellen Miller (1854–1929).  All work was made in the town. The original intention of the society was to reproduce the look of 18th century colonial embroideries using only blue and white yarns. Early on the Deerfield work was exhibitied frequently at Arts and Crafts exhibitions. Numerous references to the work of the society appeared in the contemporary press (House Beautiful, American Homes and Gardens, Mordern Priscilla, Handicrafts, etc.) and Deerfield was always described as the foremost of the village industries which appeared at that time.

Within a few years the Society of Blue and White Needlework was using yarns and fabrics in a wide range of colors for their work. Members of the society did their own dyeing. The range of patterns expanded to include contemporary designs. However, the name remained the same and was in use until the society disbanded in 1926.",,,34,,,18051617,,,,,,"Deerfield Society of Blue and White Needlework (American, 1896–1926)",,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18051617/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Louis Isadore Kahn (1901-1974) studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania under Paul P. Cret for whom he worked upon graduation.  During the Depression years of the 1930s, Kahn focused his career on public housing, joining the Works Progress Administration and the Architectural Research Group whose populist agenda was based on European avant-garde social ideas. He opened his own practice in 1935.  After working initially in the International Style, he developed his distinctive approach to architecture in the early 1950s.  In buildings such as the Yale University  Art Gallery (1951-53); the Richards Medical Research Laboratories, University of Pennsylvania (1957-65);  The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA (1959-65); the National Assembly Building, Dhaka, Bangladesh (1962-74); Phillips Exeter Academy Library (1965-1972); and the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, he used combinations of brick, travertine, poured concrete, teak and other woods to create bold monumental structures in which light and the hierarchy of spaces played an important role.  Kahn’s architecture has influenced many architects working long after his death including Tadao Ando, Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers, Sir Norman Foster, Moshe Safdie, and Robert Venturi.",,,1,"Estonian-American, 1901–1974",,18064721,,,,,,Louis Kahn,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18064721/,,,,,,

"Piet Hein Eek created his first furniture made of scrap wood in 1990 as an exam project while studying at the Design Academy Eindhoven, Netherlands. He established his own studio in 1992 and built his business around the reuse of old materials. He preferred the look of old wood to new wood. Eek’s creation of the Scrapwood furniture range was a reaction against the consumer demand for flawless, mass-produced furniture. Eek wanted to show that objects created with obvious imperfections could be both attractive and functional. He did this by reversing modern production methods; he began by using discarded, abundant materials and simple production methods, and invested as much labor as possible into the creative process to make unique pieces of furniture. To Eek, discarded, scarred wood has its own inherent beauty and his wallpapers build on this aesthetic by simply putting planks to paper.

Eek’s work is sold in numerous galleries worldwide. He has exhibited at such venues as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Milan Furniture Fair in Italy, and Cibone, a design store in Tokyo, Japan.",,,3,"Dutch, b. 1967",,18064745,,,,,,Piet Hein Eek,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18064745/,,,,,23424909,23424909

"Peggy Angus saw art as something that all should enjoy. In 1922, she enrolled at the Royal College of Art, where she studied design from Paul Nash, whose style was deeply rooted in English tradition. Upon graduation, Peggy began teaching in Nuneaton, where she also explored social realism in her artwork. In 1933, she moved to Sussex where she rented a cottage that would become the central meeting place for all her friends and colleagues. Architects, artists, designers, and thinkers of the day met there making it a wonderfully creative environment for all involved.
Peggy’s social leanings were apparent in her work and she became known as “Red Angus” for her visit to Russia and her illustrations in The Daily Worker and the Labour Party. She was teaching at North London Collegiate School, when the linocut designs she had her students make for tiles were noticed by architect FRS Yorke. She eventually was commissioned by Heathrow Airport, which was newly constructed. 
Peggy established her hand-blocked wallpaper design practice in 1960. She produced bold and colorful designs that she preferred over machine-made papers.",,,2,"British, 1904–1993",,18046643,,,,,,Peggy Angus,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18046643/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"Born into a family of decorative artists going back to the 17th century, Jean-Baptiste Huet trained with the animal painter Charles Dagomer (?-1766).  Probably through Dagomer, Huet was introduced to Gilles Demarteau, principal engraver for Francois Boucher.  After 1766 he continued his studies with one of Boucher's former students, Jean-Baptise Le Prince (1734-1781).  Huet was accepted as a member of the Royal Acdemy of Painting and Sculpture on July 29, 1769.  While he contiued to exhibit paintings regularly at the Salons, he spent the last thirty years (starting around 1785) of his life focused primarily on designing printed textiles for the Oberkampf Manufactury in Jouy-en-Josas, France.",,,47,"French, 1745 - 1811",,18043497,,,,,,Jean-Baptiste Marie Huet,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18043497/,,,,,23424819,23424819

"Hilda Jesser studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule for Women and Girls (School of Applied Arts) in Vienna from 1914-17 first in the general course under architect Oskar Strnad and, in 1915 in the architecture program under Josef Hoffmann, where she concentrated on textile and fashion design. She started working at the Wiener Werkstätte in 1916 where she continued until 1922 under director Dagobert Peche.  There, she proved to be one of their most versatile artists, designing works in a variety of media, including ceramics, commerical graphics, embroidery, glass, ivory, lace, lamps, leather, metalwork, postcards, toys, and wall paintings.   She was especially noted for her painting skills, however, she produced only a small selection of ceramic designs. Her rare ceramic works generally share a deliberate limited coloration and decoration, but often with innovative glazes, and a special emphasis on function. Jesser assumed a teaching role at the Kunstgewerbeschule in 1922, and became a full professor in 1935. While forced to stop teaching by the Nazis in 1938, she resumed her position there in 1945.",,,2,"(Austrian, 1894-1985)",,18044949,,,,,,Hilda Jesser,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044949/,,,,,23424750,23424750

"Charles Rennie Mackintosh is widely recognised as one of those crucial figures in the history of art and architecture who make the discoveries that alert others to the way forward.  He has been enrolled as a pioneer of modern design, herald of the International Style, prophet of Post-Modernism.  He also designed the Glasgow School of Art, as well as interior designs for many interiors.

Although Mackintosh was a very accomplished architect, he was also an important designer and watercolorist. Mackintosh's furniture was designed for specific rooms and settings. He insisted that form should follow function, and the function of his furniture was to make a visual statement. 

Mackintosh was born in 1868 in Glasgow, a city with which he was closely associated for the rest of his life. He studied to be an architect in Glasgow, and attended evening classes on art and design at the Glasgow School of Art. The majority of Mackintosh’s work was commissioned between 1896 and 1910. In addition to the Glasgow School of Art, he also designed the interiors of Miss Kate Cranston’s tearooms, the private houses of William Davidson and Walter Blackie. He was very popular in Germany and Austria, where he became friends with the designer Josef Hoffmann. He was commissioned to design the Warndorfer Music Salon, and he exhibited his work at the Turin International Exhibition of 1902. In contrast, he struggled to find success in Scotland. As he insisted on designing a house in its entirety, few clients were willing to hire Mackintosh. In 1914, he moved to the coast with his wife and painted watercolors. The following year, the couple moved to London, where he resumed work as an architect and designer. In 1923, the Mackintoshes moved once again, this time to the South of France, where Mackintosh only painted landscapes. He died of cancer on 10 December, 1928.",,,5,"Scottish, 1868–1928",,18044987,,,,,,Charles Rennie Mackintosh,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044987/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"Eva Anttila was born in Tampere, Finland. She studied painting at the school of the Finnish Art Society between 1913 and 1915, and then studied design, art history, and pattern making. She graduated from the Upper Department of Industrial Design in 1917 with a focus on pattern design.
Anttila participated in several group painting exhibitions throughout her early career and had one solo show in 1923. However, critics questioned why she continued painting when she was already a well-known and extremely talented textile designer.
Between 1917 and 1937, Anttila drew about 200 textile designs for Suomen Kasityon Ystavat, the handicraft association. These drawings demonstrate how her style developed. In the 1910s she focused on design for different textile techniques including embroidery, batik, and weaving, as well as functional designs, such as tablecloths, lamp shades, and wallcoverings; from the 1920s on, her focus shifted to woven textiles used for interior decoration.
Even though Anttila had trained as a painter rather than a weaver, she was able to acquire the knowledge of the weaving technique. She believed that this was the only way to be a successful textile designer. In 1920 she became the first designer of patterns and weavings at the home goods company Kotiteollisuus O. Y. Pirtti.
In 1924, Anttila opened a studio and began designing for interiors; most of all, rugs.  In the 1930s, she traveled around Europe showing her work and won several honors.
After the war, Anttila set aside her paintbrushes and focused solely on tapestry design. Success immediately followed and led to major tapestry commissions from the Finnish Embassy in Warsaw and the Bank of Finland’s office in Vaasa. The latter brought a tremendous amount of attention at an international scale, including North America and South America. At age 69, Anttila visited the United States for the first time and met several prominent artists and collectors. Of particular importance was her introduction to John Hurschler, the California art dealer, who not only sold her tapestries in the United States until 1973, but also gave her ten commissions.
Anttila continued to exhibit her work through the 1980s.",,,4,"Finnish, 1894–1993",,18063457,,,,,,Eva Anttila,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18063457/,,,,,23424812,23424812

"The multidisciplinary designer Piet Zwart worked as a photographer, graphic and industrial designer, and architect in the 1920s and 30s.  He is one of the most well known and influential designers from the interwar period, particularly in the field of modern graphic design.   Trained as an architect at the School of Applied Arts in Amsterdam, he was hired by the architect and De Stijl member Jan Wils, from whom he absorbed the abstract, linear, and geometric qualities of De Stijl design into his own work.   He soon rejected some of the movement’s principles, notably the emphasis on symmetry, the use of strict horizontals and verticals, and the stern dogmatism.  In addition to De Stijl, Zwart was drawn to other avant-garde movements, particularly Russian Constructivism and Dada.  While Zwart worked for the architect Hendrik P. Berlage from 1921-27, by 1923 he had already began his graphic design and typographic career.  He was hired by the Nederlandsche Kabelfabriek (Dutch Cable Manufacturers) in Delft, for whom he made hundreds of designs for advertisements and brochures.  Zwart remained with the company until 1933 when he resigned to become an interior, industrial and furniture designer.  


Zwart is best known for his graphic design work.  Recognizing typography as a powerful cultural force, he identified himself as a ‘typotect’--part typographer, part architect in that he built a composition with text.  His work is characterized stylistically by the use of primary shapes and colors, varying typefaces, strong diagonals, and a careful asymmetry, at the same time integrating visual puns, alliteration and repetition.  In 1926 Zwart began using photomontage in his compositions, creating contrast between two-dimensional type and the three-dimensional image.  His innovative style and methods were noted by members of the Bauhaus School in Dessau who invited Zwart to host a series of lectures in 1929. Starting in 1930, Zwart was hired by the Bruynzeel Wood Company for whom he designed printed advertising, packaging and office interiors.  His most important Bruynzeel commission was a modular kitchen constructed from prefabricated units which was mass produced from 1938 for the Dutch market.   Arrested and held hostage by the Germans during World War II, he concentrated afterwards primarily on industrial design. His influence on generations of succeeding designers has been greatly recognized and won him the title of ‘Designer of the Century’ by the Association of Dutch Designers in 2000.",,,8,"Dutch, 1885 – 1977",,18044821,,,,,,Piet Zwart,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044821/,,,,,23424909,23424909

"Pottery operating out of a convent in Meurthe et Moselle region of France. The Huart family owned both pottery and convent. In 1865 the pottery passed into the hands of Fernand and Hyppolye d'Huart, who built new workshops producing wares decorated with enamel, known as ""Emaux de Longwy,"" similar in appearance to the cloisonné enamel technique used in metalwork.

The enameled faience technique was developed at Longwy in response to the popularity of cloisonne from Persia and Japan. In 1870, factory directors Fernand and Hippolyte d'Huart hired Italian artist,  Amedee de Caranza, to create a pottery that resembled cloisonne and would appeal to the general taste for orientalism in France. Caranza had worked in Japan and understood the traditional brass wire technique used in cloisonne. At Longwy he developed and perfected a method of printing black lines on the surface of fired earthenware to create a thin, bas-relief wall around each design segment. The individual cells were hand-painted in the studio with enamels -sometimes using as many as 25 different colors, the piece was then re-fired. Burnt sienna or India ink was rubbed into the surface of the piece to pick up fine glaze cracks or crazing. Amedee de Caranza later moved to Bordeaux to work for a competitor, but his technique remained a signature style for Emaux de Longwy.

Currently, the firm is known as Société des Faienceries de Longwy et Senelle.",,,1,founded late 17th century,,18044879,,,,,,Longwy Pottery,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18044879/,,,,,23424819,23424819

"Founded by J.F. Weaver in 1890 and incorporated by George Young in 1892, Roseville Pottery started as a specialized utilitarian pottery manufactory in Roseville, Ohio. As Roseville gained prominence, producing stoneware flower pots and earthenware vases, Young began purchasing other manufactories in Ohio. He moved Roseville’s entire operation to Zanesville, Ohio by 1910. Roseville Pottery continued producing Arts and Crafts-oriented utility wares until it closed in 1953. The Rozane and Della Robbia lines are among its best-known.

"Braun AG (later Braun GmbH) was founded in 1921 in Frankfurt, Germany, by Max Braun, an engineer. The company originally produced radio parts, and was one of the first to combine radios and phonographs into one product.  After World War II, during which the Frankfurt factories were badly damaged, Braun began rebuilding the company, and introduced its first electric shaver. When Max Braun died in 1951, his sons Artur and Erwin assumed leadership of the company. After their wartime experiences under the harsh Nazi regime, the brothers longed to establish a new work model that respected people. They quickly began to offer their employees comprehensive health care, a cafeteria serving nutritious meals, and even an employee magazine.

In the mid-1950s, with the assistance of Wilhelm Wagenfeld, and students at the design academy in Ulm that sought to carry on the work of the Bauhaus, Erwin Braun revamped the entire line of Braun products.  Braun created its first design department, headed by Fritz Eichler, however, the hiring of industrial designer Dieter Rams in 1955, would have an even greater impact on design at Braun, as the company developed more products for domestic use. Braun became known for its minimal, functional, understandable designs of electronics and home products. Today, Braun’s focus is on grooming products and small kitchen appliances, but the company's philosophy and emphasis on good design remains the same.

He gained notoriety in the early 1980s when he was appointed to design a room in President Francois Mitterand’s quarters in the Élysée Palace. In 1984, he achieved international prominence, virtually overnight, with his design of the Café Costes and the Costes chair produced by Driade. Since then, he has continued to be regarded as a leader of contemporary French design.

"Henry Dreyfuss, American industrial designer, was born in New York City, New York in 1904 and died in Pasadena, California in 1972. 
At the New York Society for Ethical Culture's High School he learned the rudiments of staging theatrical production and in 1923, he became active as a stage designer for the theatre productions on Broadway. He worked as an apprentice with Norman Bel Geddes on several hit shows, and also as design consultant for Macy's, where he insisted on collaborating with the manufactures. In 1927 Dreyfuss set out on his own and in 1928 opened his own office in New York; subsequently, opened a second office in Pasadena, California. Soon, he distinguished himself as a designer for mass production. By favoring practically over art deco and streamlined styling, he gained the use of anthropometrics (the study of human dimensions and capabilities) into his practice; the results of this study were published in a series of volumes by MIT Press and discussed in his books Designing for People (1955) and The Measure of Man (1960). Dreyfuss became a founding member of the Society of Industrial Design and first president of the Industrial Designers Society of America. The vast number of objects Dreyfuss designed included aircraft interiors for Lockheed, hearing aids, clocks, Bell telephones (1930-33 Bell300 and 1965 Trimline model), Hoover products (from 1934), RCA TV sets (from1964), decanters for Thermos, farm vehicles for John Deere (including 1956 720 tractor), oceanliners Constitution and 1951 Independence, and New York Central Railroad's 1941 Twentieth Century Limited, which was more extravagant than usual for Dreyfuss. 
In 1968, after retiring from his design firm, Dreyfuss remained consultant to Bell Laboratories, Polaroid, and others.",,,235,"American, 1904–1972",,18041501,,,,,,Henry Dreyfuss,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18041501/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Sony Corporation was formed in 1946 in Tokyo as a radio-repair shop, and today manufactures an array of technological goods to great success. Sony's radios launched the company to fame and became the first Japanese design to achieve international status. In the 1950s, Sony developed a reputation for transistor technology, which it used in portable radios. The company produced the TR-55, it's first transistor radio, in 1955. Throughout the 1950s and 60s, Sony's design department had a distinct approach to radio design, which became a design philosophy for all their consumer electronics: ""...create a market with bold, innovative, products. Refine the approach. Create the icon that everyone recognizes....""

"Chester Gould, a veteran cartoonist, began drawing his most legendary character, the dashing and daring Dick Tracy for the newspaper comics page in 1931. Modeled in the image of the innovative Sherlock Holmes, Gould was inspired to create new crime-fighting technology, including the two-way wrist TV, closed circuit TV police line-up and the engineless car that took Dick Tracy to the moon (both literally and figuratively).

"Julia McVicker moved to Chicago and married commercial artist, George Rufus McVicker. In 1939, she enrolled at the School of Design, where she studied under Marli Ehrman. In 1945, she and Else Regensteiner opened their own studio called reg/wick HAND WOVEN ORIGINALS. They designed directly on the loom and produced custom-ordered hand woven fabrics for architects’ use. They also created samples for industrial mills. McVicker was deeply involved in her community, teaching weaving at Chicago’s Lighthouse for the Blind, being active at the weavers Guild of America, the Industrial Designers Institute, and the American Crafts Council.

"Industrial designer, design educator and author, Naoto Fukasawa, believes that design should be intuitive and seamlessly engaging to those who experience it. One of Japan's most influential contemporary designers, he is noted for creating designs that are both functionally and conceptually sound. ""Fukasawa's  innovative designs of familiar objects are based on his close observations of how we use things in our everday lives. Rather than focusing on objects in isolation, he considers how they relate to their surroundings.”[1] 
Born in 1956 in Yamanashi prefecture, Japan, Fukasawa graduated from Tama Art University in 1980. He designs objects that are, as he describes, 'close to the body.' He thinks that design should be a part of the human experience, and the story of how an object comes to be is as important as the final design. After spending eight years as the head of the American design firm IDEO's Tokyo office, he established Naoto Fukasawa Design in 2003. That same year, he helped start the Plus Minus Zero brand of household and electronics products. Fukasawa has received more than 40 international awards, and his work is included in the permanent collections of museums throughout the world. He is currently a professor at Musashino Art University and a visiting lecturer at Tama Art University.

"Lee Bontecou attended the Art Students League of New York (1952-55) and studied sculpture under William Zorach. She went to Rome on a Fulbright Scholarship and then received the Louis Comfort Tiffany Award in 1959. After early success in the 1950s through the early 1970s, Bontecou turned to teaching at Brooklyn College. She stayed there until 1991. Her work can be described as collage; she uses stretched cloth and welded steel to produce her sculptural forms. Her drawings are typically precise studies for her sculptures. Bontecou focuses on the circle, a pure form, and from there fractures her sculpture or drawing with precision.",,,2,"American, b. 1931",,18535507,,,,,,Lee Bontecou,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18535507/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Helen Kramer is best known for her handwoven drapery and upholstery. In the 1930s, she attended the Traphagen School of Design in New York, studying costume design. She traveled through Europe where she studied handweaving and fabric design. She liked to experiment with color. Kramer opened a showroom on Madison Avenue in New York, and then she and her brother, Boris, began working together under the brand name, Cromwell. During the early 1940s, she accompanied her husband, a doctor, to the Ashford General Hospital, where she launched a training program for occupational therapists to teach weaving. After the war, she opened a studio on Lexington Avenue.",,,234,"American, 1907–1977",,18535597,,,,,,Helen Kroll Kramer,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18535597/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Fortunato Pio Castellani (1794-1865) was a Roman Antique dealer, jeweler and goldsmith who was the most significant influence on Victorian jewelry and is credited as the pioneer of the Greek and Etruscan classical revival in the early 1860s, better known as the archaeological revival style of jewelry.  This style was extremely popular in both Europe and America.  Fascinated by the jewels of antiquity, he studied the style and techniques of ancient Etruscan (western Tuscany) goldsmiths who had attained technical perfection during the 7th to 5th centuries BC.  The styles contained gold granulation and filigree and included decorative motifs such as rosettes, urns and amphora.

The Castellani family, Fortunato in collaboration iwth his two sons Allesandro and Augusto, was responsible for jewelry's return to antiquity and resulting archaeoligical revival style dominating the mid nineteenth century.

Castellani displayed his new creations at the world's Great Exhibitions:  Florence (1861), London (1867 & 1878), Vienna (1873), Philadelphia (1876) and Turin (1884).

"Born in 1940, Marcia Goodman was a classical pianist, a piano restorer, an actress, a partner in the Portnoy Goodman Jordan Volpe Gallery, a screenwriter, and a filmmaker. Along with her husband William, she was an avid collector of American Art Pottery. She and her husband William purchased their first piece of pottery in 1968 at an auction in upstate New York. The Samuel Weller ceramic pedastal was the beginning of their diverse collection, which contained a number of Rookwood and Tiffany pieces. She moved from New York, her longtime home, to San Diego in 1993. She died in 2004, survived by her children Emily Evans, Amy Goodman Kiefer, and Michael Goodman.

"Hildreth Meière (1892–1961) was among the most important members of the 1920s and 1930s generation of New York-based modernist painters and designers. An exceptionally accomplished and productive decorative designer, her mosaic murals and metal reliefs graced public buildings as well as domestic interiors all over America. Only recently has she been restored to her rightful position as a major contributor to the rise of modernism in America. 

Trained at the San Francisco School of Fine Arts and the Art Students League in New York, Meière built a career designing mosaics and mural paintings for buildings including the National Academy of Sciences, Washington D.C. (1924); the Nebraska State Capitol, Lincoln, Nebraska (1924–29); One Wall Street, New York (1931); the Walker-Lespenard Telephone Company, New York (1932); and Illinois Bell Telephone, Chicago (ca. 1938). Her special area of expertise was designing mosaics and stained glass for religious institutions such as St. Thomas’ Church (1935); St. Bartholomew’s (1928–29, 1948–49); and St. Patrick’s Cathedral (1940), all in New York City, as well as Washington’s National Cathedral (1951). She gained particular attention in New York when she was awarded dual commissions in 1932 for metal panels on the exteriors of both the RKO Building and Radio City Music Hall in Rockefeller Center.

Meière was particularly proud of her World’s Fair commissions.[1] For the 1933 Chicago Century of Progress Exhibition, she executed the Progress of Women mural for the National Council of Women and the decoration of the terracotta pool floor for an American Telephone and Telegraph installation. For the 1939–40 New York World’s Fair, she completed eight exterior murals for Fair buildings including Medicine and Public Health, American Telephone, and the Temple of Religion.

"George Nelson is one of the most influential figures in American post-war modernism. 
After studying architecture at Yale University, Nelson was awarded a Rome Prize. During his two years there he conducted interviews with leading European modernists—Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius—which were published in the magazine Pencil Points, establishing Nelson as a voice that would shape design thinking in the coming decades. 
 After returning to the US, Nelson taught architecture at Columbia University, and became associate editor of Architecture Forum. He was invited to design his first collection for Herman Miller in 1945, and was named design director in 1947. Over the course of his long association with Herman Miller, Nelson designed dozens of iconic of pieces of furniture, and also re-designed the company’s corporate identity—logo, catalogues, signage, even hang tags. He also invited collaboration with designers like Charles and Ray Eames, Alexander Girard, and Isamu Noguchi. 
Nelson developed his own architecture, graphic design, industrial design and exhibition projects in his New York City studio, George Nelson & Associates. In addition to his large body of design work, Nelson continued to write, producing numerous books and over 150 magazine articles.",,,4,"American, 1907 – 1986",,18537495,,,,,,George Nelson,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18537495/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Carlo Scarpa was born in Venice in 1906, and lived in the Veneto for most of his life, until his death in 1978 at the age of 72. In 1919, he enrolled in the fine arts academy, simultaneously gaining work experience in local planning offices. He received his diploma and first personal commission the same year, in 1925; the latter was for Giacomo Cappellin, to restore the Palazzo da Mula in Murano, which housed Cappellin’s glassmaking company’s administrative offices. The work introduced him to glassmaking, and the following year he started to design glasswares for the company, MVM Cappellin, doing so until it closed in 1932. That year, he went to Venini, for whom he designed for fifteen years, serving as an artistic director.

As an architect, he designed both major and minor works, almost exclusively in the Veneto region—though his influence and ideas reached around the world. Some of his major works include the Villa Zoppas (1948–53), Olivetti Showroom (1957), the Casa Veritti (1957–61), the Querini Stampalia Foundation (1961-63), the Museo Corner (1957–60), Brion-Vega Cemetery (1970–72), and Villa Ottolenghi (1974–79), among numerous others. 

Scarpa received many awards and honors throughout his lifetime, including the Diploma of Honor for glass objects at the Milan Triennale (1940), Olivetti National Prize for Architecture (1956), IN-ARCH National prize and gold medal from the Ministry of Education for his work at Verona’s Castelvecchio Museum (1962), President of the Republic’s Prize for Architecture (1967), and the honoris causa degree in architecture (1978). In addition to designing and planning various exhibitions, his own work was also shown in many, including the Venice Biennales, Milan Triannales, and New York MoMA’s 1967 architecture show. He was appointed director of the Venice Institute of Architecture in 1972.

"Walter von Nessen virtually pioneered the field of residential lighting. Born in Germany, he trained in furniture design in that country during the 1920s.Von Nessen immigrated to the United States in 1925 and opened Nessen Studios in New York City in 1927. His practice was almost exclusively devoted to the design and fabrication of architectural lighting. He quickly created a name for himself, attracting the attention of leading architects with his sleek industrial designs. Von Nessen began to receive commissions to design lighting and other household items for top clients and was among the first wave of American industrial designers. He was also among the industrial designers such as Russel Wright,  and Lurelle Guild, who designed wares for the Chase Copper and Brass Company in the 1930s.",,,7,"American, 1889 - 1943",,18537453,,,,,,Walter von Nessen,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18537453/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"The Chase Brass and Copper Company was founded in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 1876 by Henry Sabin Chase. The company became one of the largest brass manufacturers in the city and continued to expand throughout the early 20th century, acquiring additional companies for the production of copper. The firm produced consumer and industrial products including buttons, novelties, copper pipe and plumbing supplies. During the 1930s, when demand for these types of goods declined due to the Great Depression, Chase, seeking to increase its business, entered the consumer market with a line of modern household goods made of chrome-plated metal, copper, and brass. The stylish, streamlined wares were created by some of the leading industrial designers of the day, including Russel Wright, Lurelle Guild, and Walter Von Nessen. This specialty product line resulted in more than 500 decorative accessory, tableware, and lighting, designs, and lasted for twelve years. Chase discontinued the line in the early 1940s when the company was engaged by the US government to produce war materials, such as shell and gun casings, during World War II. Chase moved from Waterbury in 1975. Today, Brass Chase and Copper Company, LLC is based in Montpelier, Ohio.",,,68,Founded 1876,,18537451,,,,,,Chase Brass & Copper Co.,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18537451/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"A division of the Herman Miller furniture company, the Herman Miller Clock Company was founded in 1926. The firm initially manufactured mantle and table clocks in traditional styles, but by 1933 introduced a line of sleek, modern, Art Deco-era clocks designed by pioneer industrial designer Gilbert Rohde, who had been hired by Herman Miller to create modern furniture lines. Rohde designed furniture for the company from 1932 until his death in 1944. In 1937 Herman Miller president, D.J. De Pree turned the clock business over to his brother-in-law, Howard Miller, who renamed it the Howard Miller Clock Company. Starting in 1947, Howard Miller began producing a number of wall and table clocks by designer George Nelson (by then, Director of Design at the Herman Miller Furniture Company). Many of Nelson's clocks, such as his Ball and Spindel models, became icons of mid-twentieth century modernism. Production of designs by Nelson and several of his contemporaries continued into the 1980s. The Howard Miller Clock Company is still active today, however the product lines once again favor predominantly traditional tastes.",,,3,founded 1926,,18537497,,,,,,Herman Miller Clock Company,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18537497/,,,,,23424977,23424977
"Dale Chihuly is, arguably, the most recognizable name in the American studio glass movement. Rather approaching each piece as a solitary glass blower, he employs teams of artisans to work the glass. This innovative approach to production has enabled Chihuly to escalate the size of his glass installations to the monumental. Since the 1970s, Chihuly has developed a distinctive vocabulary of glass forms and colors while continuing to innovate through his numerous public and private commissions. His works have taken over public spaces as diverse as The New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx and the Tower of David in Jerusalem, and have brought an increased interest to glass as both a decorative and functional medium.",,,13,"American, b. 1941",,18537465,,,,,,Dale Chihuly,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18537465/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Monguzzi was born in Mendrisio, in the Ticino region of Switzerland, in 1941. He studied in Geneva and London, spent part of his early career in at the studio of Antonio Boggeri, in Milan. The inspiration of the experimental and visually-daring work of the avant garde designers Herbert Bayer, El Lissitsky, Jan Tschichold, Piet Zwart, Paul Schuitema, Ladislav Sutnar, Theo van Doesburg, and Kirill Zdanevich were vital to the development of Monguzzi’s own typographic applications and designs for a dynamic graphic language. In 1965, he moved to Montreal in order to design nine pavilions for Expo 1967. In his designs for the pavilions, Monguzzi applied ideas about three-dimensional structure and perception as a way to meet the challenges of both creating universal forms of communication and contextualized environments for an international audience. 

In 1968, he returned to Milan, where he established his own design studio. In 1971, he received the Bodoni Prize for his contributions to Italian graphic design. That same year, he relocated to Lugano, Switzerland, when he joined the faculty of the Lugano School of Design to teach courses in the psychology of perception and typographic design. From 1986 to 1991, Monguzzi served as art consultant to the architecture and design magazine Abitare, published in Milan. Monguzzi’s work on the graphic identity and visual communications program for the Musée de Orsay in Paris (1986) led to his work for the Museo Cantonale d’Arte. Monguzzi’s work on visual communication materials for the Museo Cantonale d’Arte continued into the first years of the 21st century, and is regarded as among the chief achievements of his career.",,,4,"Swiss, b. 1941",,18539311,,,,,,Bruno Monguzzi,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18539311/,,,,,23424957,23424957

"Work by the pioneering American industrial and furniture designer, Gilbert Rohde, is notable for its thoroughly modern, informal, and multifunctional qualities. Rohde’s ability to create appealing modernist furnishings for middle-class homes, while also devising merchandising strategies to sell these goods, places him within a unique framework in American design history. A product of New York City public schools, his post-high school education included courses at the Art Students League and the Grand Central School of Art. Rohde’s visit to Europe in the spring and summer of 1927 (with later trips in 1931 and 1937) to see the Bauhaus in Dessau and the French modernist design that debuted in the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris, profoundly inspired his concept of design and the role it should play in daily life. The French art deco and German rationalist styles he saw in Europe influenced the furniture he designed from the late 1920s into the 1940s—pieces he created to suit the rapidly changing American lifestyle. 

In addition to his renowned work for Herman Miller Inc., Rohde also designed for several other furniture firms, including Thonet, Troy Sunshade, and Heywood-Wakefield. What set Rohde apart from his contemporaries was his all-encompassing understanding of the furniture industry, from design and production to marketing and showroom display.[1] During his time with Herman Miller Inc. (1932–44), Rohde set the standard for collaborative efforts between designers and furniture firms, with George Nelson and Charles and Ray Eames later following in his footsteps. In 1944, Rohde was killed in an automobile accident. Herman Miller produced his designs posthumously until 1946.

"Sara Provan was born in the Bronx and attended the National Academy, the Art Students League, and Columbia University. Eventually she received a certificate with a focus in painting from the Cooper Union School of Art. Provan began gaining recognition during the 1930s and 40s by exhibiting throughout New York City. In 1950, she received national recognition when her work was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s “American Painting Today”. She began designing for Jack Lenor Larsen’s textile company. Provan joined the faculty in the Fine Arts department of Monmouth College in New Jersey. There, she taught painting, design and composition. Her work can be described as loose, painterly and abstract.",,,4,"American, 1917–1993",,18538321,,,,,,Sara Provan,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18538321/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Born in Switzerland in 1908, Erik Nitsche was a graphic designer known for his innovative work in book design, illustration, and typography.   Nitsche studied at the Collège Classique in Switzerland and the Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich before immigrating to the United States in 1934. He designed a number of covers for avant-garde and multilingual cultural publications in Europe as well as illustrations and covers for major American magazines such as Life, Town and Country, Harper’s Bazaar and Vanity Fair.  Nitsche also developed advertising and promotional campaigns for the cinema giant Twentieth Century Fox and the New York Transit Authority, and produced more than 200 album covers for Decca Records.  Nitsche may be best known for his historic relationship with General Dynamics, whose innovative graphic identity and information graphics he produced in the 1950s. He  was also responsible for more than 2,000 color illustrations reproduced in the five-volume encyclopedia L’Épopée Nationale d’un Siècle.  Nitsche continued to work actively in design until his death in 1998.",,,14,"Swiss, 1908 - 1998",,18538331,,,,,,Erik Nitsche,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18538331/,,,,,23424957,23424957

"Serge Chermayeff was born in the Caucasus in 1900 and recieved his education in England. Much of his early architectural work is there. He taught at the European Mediterranean Academy in Cavalière, France in the early 1930s. In 1939 he came to the US to accept a post at the San Francisco Art Institute and Brooklyn College while pursuing private practice. At Brooklyn College he was chairman of the design department from 1942-1946. He was later on the faculty of the Illinois Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Insititute of Technology.  In 1953 he accepted a position as head of the department of architecture at Harvard. From 1962-1970 he served as head of the architecture department at Yale. 
Among the noted buildings he designed are: the seaside Bexhill Pavillon in England; the Clarence Mayhew House in Oakland and the Horn House in Marin County, CA.
He was the author, with C. Alexander, of ""Community and Privacy: Toward a New Architecture of Humanism""(1963) and with Alexander Tzonis, of ""Shape of Community: Realization of Human Potential"" (1971).
He was the co-founder of the American Society of Planners and Architects. He also served as president, on recommendation of Gropius, of the Chicago Institute of Design.
He died at age 95 in Wellfleet, MA in 1996.",,,13,"American, b. Grozny, Chechnya  1900–1996",,18536373,,,,,,Serge Ivan Chermayeff,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18536373/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Edith Brown was one of the founders of the Saturday Evening Girls Club, a foundation started as the result of the belief that women’s lives needed to be improved in the late 19th century. The SEG would eventually turn into Paul Revere Pottery.  Brown was an artist who was born in Nova Scotia and moved to Boston in the early 1890s. She attended the Museum School where she met Edith Guerrier, a librarian and writer.  Edith Brown and Edith Guerrier, along with their benefactor, Helen Storrow, wanted to help women find a stronger voice in American society. They looked to the Arts and Crafts Movement as a way to bring together the creativity of female artists. The Society of Arts and Crafts, Boston, elected Brown to Crafstman in 1909 and then Mastercraftsman in 1913. Paul Revere Pottery achieved Mastership into the Society in 1917.",,,2,"American, b.

"Agostino Brunias, born in Italy, was in London exhibiting at the Society of Arts by 1763. He worked in London as a painter and engraver until commissioned to go to Dominica (the future Santo Domingo/Haiti) possibly by the British Colonial governor in about 1770.He remained there, dying in 1796.
 He painted large scenes of figures of blacks, mixed race and white plantation owners to servants, in various types of clothing in landscapes. Some of these were sent back to England and displayed in exhibitions at the Royal Academy and elsewhere. He also produced engravings of similar scenes while there. Six of the set of eighteen buttons stated to have been owned by Toussaint L'Ouverture, in the Museum's collection are the same subjects as six engravings by Brunias.",,,18,"Italian, ca. 1730–1796",,18537399,,,,,,Agostino Brunias,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18537399/,,,,,,

"Hideko Takahashi (b.1950) is part of a younger generation of Japanese designers working within what now could be considered a tradition of Japanese experimentation with textile forms and surfaces. Educated at the Otsuka Textile Design Institute, Takahashi has also studied and apprenticed with Junichi Arai, one of the pre-eminent textile designers of the last twenty years. She learned from Arai the importance of combining both the hand and advanced technology in textile design and production. Takahashi has focused her investigations and experimentations primarily in the medium of wool fiber and has transformed two-dimensional planes of wool into three-dimensional sculptural surfaces.",,,1,,,18539241,,,,,,Hideko Takahashi,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18539241/,,,,,23424856,23424856

"Mr. William Day Gates founded the American Terra Cotta and Ceramic Company in Terra Cotta, Ilinois, in 1881. The Gates Potteries developed as a branch of this company and was set up around 1890 to make plain, undecorated garden pottery.
The ""Teco"" name is derived from the first syllables of the words terra and cotta. The name was used as early as 1895 although the pottery was not available to the public until 1901.
The parent company, American Terra Cotta and Ceramic Company (founded in 1881) was sold, five years before William Gates's death in 1935.",,,2,1890 – 1930,,18539283,,,,,,The Gates Potteries,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18539283/,,,,,,

"Architect: New York-based

Steven Holl ranks among America’s leading innovators in contemporary architecture. He was among the designers featured in the museum’s 2000 National Design Triennial, the same year he was also a National Design Awards finalist. 

Holl is a remarkable and prolific draftsman. Drawing is a vital part of his design process. This involves numerous watercolors drawings that serve as unique explorations and vital visualizations of his architectural thought. He is never without his sketchbook. Holl constantly refers to his drawings as he develops a building’s overall design of space and structure, or works out details. This “visual dialogue,” in turn, generates new drawings that work in tandem with other methods of design development being produced by his office (e.g. models, computer aided designs). Representing Holl’s architecture is an acquisition goal for our collection. 

The 1990s was an extraordinarily significant decade in Holl’s career. He received numerous major commissions and his international stature grew as he received several prestigious architectural awards and AIA honors. In addition to the Chapel of St. Ignatius, his other award winning projects include: Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki, Finland (1998); Cranbrook Institute of Science, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (1998); Makuhari Housing, Chiba, Japan (1996); Void Space/Hinged Space Housing, Fukuoka, Japan (1990); the Y-House, Catskills, New York (1997–99); the Stretto House, Dallas (1992). During this decade, his work was the subject of several major exhibitions and he wrote two books discussing scientific phenomena in relation to his work, Intertwining (1996) and Parallax (2000).",,,11,"American, b. 1947",,18536969,,,,,,Steven Holl,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18536969/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"As a girl, in Germany, Ruth Adler Schee was artistically trained by Paul Klee, a family friend. In 1938, she and her family escaped Nazi Germany and moved to Detroit, Michigan. She enrolled at RISD five years later. Schnee was named “Detroit’s Treasure” for her leadership in bringing modernism to the city. She collaborated with renowned designers, such as Charles and Ray Eames, Buckminster Fuller, and Frank Lloyd Wright. As a woman and a Jew, Schnee was a pioneer of her profession, taking design to a world stage.",,,1,"German, active United States, b. 1923",,18539531,,,,,,Ruth Adler Schnee,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18539531/,,,,,23424829,23424829

"Barbara Natoli Witt studied fine art and graphic design at Cooper Union, and art history at Berkeley. She became interested in textile techniques and taught classes in weaving, rug design, lace making, and macramé in the Bay Area, where one of her students introduced her to a collection of antique beads. Soon after, Witt began to incorporate beads, talismans, and amulets into the broad, woven collars of her design.

Witt’s neckpieces usually begin with a special ornament, or with the interests of a particular client. She works closely with both the object and her client. The whole composition, motifs, and color scheme of a necklace will revolve around the form and meaning of a central antique bead or talisman. Once the nylon threads are hand dyed, Witt chooses the weaving, knotting, or lace-making techniques to best complement the central ornament. Other beads or ornaments are subsequently chosen to strengthen the theme.

Witt’s clients have included artists, politicians, fashion icons, socialites, and Hollywood celebrities. Among them are Diana Vreeland, Eleanor Lambert, Clare Booth Luce, Pamela Harriman, Dinah Shore, Marella Agnelli, Nancy Marks, and Beatrice Wood, a ceramist who created special ornaments for Witt’s pieces.

"Known primarily for his influential writings on industrial design theory and practice, Egmont Arens was among the individuals who launched the industrial design profession in America during the 1920s and 1930s. His contemporaries included Walter Dorwin Teague, Donald Deskey, Norman Bel Geddes, Russel Wright, and Lurelle Guild.

Like several of his colleagues, Arens segued into the then new field of industrial design from another creative profession. He came from a publications and editorial background but, by 1929, became advertising director of the firm Earnest Elmo Calkins, where he established an industrial design styling department based on what he called “consumer engineering.” In 1932, Arens and Roy Sheldon co authored the book Consumer Engineering: A New Technique for Prosperity, primarily intended for a business and design audience.

Arens’s design work was shown in the 1939 New York World’s Fair and he was one of the 15 design practitioners who founded the Society of Industrial Designers in 1944. Throughout his career, he worked for companies such as General Electric, Fairchild Aircraft, The Carborundum Company, the Dayton Scale Company, Coca-Cola, and the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (more commonly known as A&P), producing a diverse range of designs including freight cars, airplanes, coffee grinders, refrigerators, candy, graphics, and packaging. Among his best known work is his 1937 Model K stand mixer for the Hobart Manufacturing Company. KitchenAid still manufactures the mixer today, little changed from the original design.",,,1,"American, 1888 – 1966",,18536871,,,,,,Egmont C.

"Eva Lisa (Pipsan) Saarinen Swanson is part of an influential design family. Her father was the architect and designer Eliel Saarinen, her mother was the textile designer and sculptor, Loja Saarinen, and her brother was architect Eero Saarinen. Pipsan was born in Finland in 1905 and moved with her family to the United States in 1923. The family eventually settled in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where Saarinen became the resident architect at the Cranbrook Academy of Art. Pipsan was involved with her father’s projects at Cranbrook, including designing decorative motifs for the Cranbrook School for Boys (1926), the Saarinen House (1930), and the Kingswood School Cranbrook (1931). She began teaching costume and interior design at Cranbrook in the early 1930s and collaborated on interior design projects with her husband’s architectural firm. (Her husband, J. Robert F. Swanson, was a former student of Saarinen’s). In 1939, she created, with her husband and father, the Flexible Home Arrangements group of furniture, manufactured by Johnson Furniture Company of Grand Rapids, Michigan, to provide contemporary furniture appropriate to the modern structures Swanson was designing.

The Saarinen Swanson Group, which debuted in 1947, formed to embody contemporary design and offer versatility and affordability for the modern postwar home. Pipsan’s designs for the Saarinen Swanson Group included the modernist glassware design Flower Floater/Candleholder no. 5905-20, screen-printed textiles for the Goodall Fabric Company of New York, lights for the Mutual Sunset Lamp Manufacturing Company of New York, and modestly-priced glassware for the United States Glass Company in Tiffin, Ohio. Pipsan later provided a successful line of indoor outdoor furniture, the Sol-Air Group, produced by Ficks Reed Company; her textile designs in the 1950s and 1960s included screen printed fabrics for Edwin Raphael Company, an award-winning design shown at the Brussels World’s Fair in 1958, and rug designs for E. T. Barwick Mills.[1]

December 26, 1926  His sketch of the actor Sacha Guitry was published in the New York Herald Tribune. Within two years, five New York newspapers, including the New York Times, were publishing his theatrical drawings. However, he continued to produce paintings, lithographs and political cartoons.

1945  To celebrate the birth of daughter Nina, he drew her name in the background of the theatrical drawing of that day for the play ""Are You With It."" 
Continued to work Nina's name into his subsequent drawings; his readers would make a game of finding the Ninas. (In 1956, he began to append a numeral, following his signature,
indicating the number of Ninas in the drawing.)
""...[A]s the years progress, you see ...line simplify and the actual strokes elongate to where you actually become amazed at the complexity of that single, simple line. The mastery and beauty of that flowing trace of ink is regularly and stylistically contrasted with fine-line textures."" (Unattributed quotation.)

"Coray was born in Wald, Switzerland on June 9, 1906, and died in Zurich on November 22, 1991. A pioneer of industrial design, his work is admired for its simplicity and functionality. He was a sculptor, primarily in metal, as well as a painter, and held a doctorate in Romance language and literature. He was part of a creative circle that included Max Bill and Anton Stankowski. His other designs include upholstered and wire seating and, in the 1950s, aluminum chairs and tables for Wohnbedarf (a progressive high-design shop founded in 1931). In connection with the 1939 Swiss National Exhibition, he also worked on the interiors of several pavilions (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",,,2,"Swiss, 1906 – 1991",,18538415,,,,,,Hans Coray,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18538415/,,,,,23424957,23424957

"Father of Piero Zen, Italian furniture designer, Carlo Zen was active in Milan, Italy.  He was both an Italian cabinetmaker and the owner of the largest furniture workshop in turn of the century Milan.  Zen was known for his furniture produced in ""Stilo Floreale,"" a combination of Art Noveau, Symbolist, and eclectic motifs.  Although he was a factory manager and not a designer per se, his firm was associated with the Haas of Vienna, thus adopting similar asymmetrical patterns and later geometric forms in furniture design.  The most renowned work of his factory was exhibited at the 1902 Exhibition of International Decorative Arts in Turin, Italy.",,,2,1851–1918,,18537909,,,,,,Carlo Zen,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/18537909/,,,,,23424853,23424853

"John Henry Belter (1804-1863) was a German-American cabinet maker. The John Henry Belter and Company Cabinet Factory was founded in 1858 on East 76th Street at 3rd Avenue in New York. The business opened in 1849 and closed in 1867. Because of the small size of his workshop, Belter is also considered the manufacturer of all of his furniture.
Influenced by the designs of John Jelliff (1813-1893), cabinetmakers (worked primarily with hand-crafted chair and sofa crests); archives at the Newark Museum.

"Liebov Papova (1889-1924) was an important female member of the Russian avant-garde along with Valentina Kulagina, Alexandra Exter, and Vavara Stepanova.  Her father was a successful textile merchant and a patron of the arts.  From an early age, she studied painting in Russia and later studied in Paris where she met Alexander Archipenko and Ossip Zadkine.  Upon her return to Moscow, she worked with Vladimir Tatlin and the Vesin brothers.  Her paintings, which she called "" painterly architectonics"" synthesized aspects of cubism and futurism.  In 1916, she became a member of the Supremus group along with Kazimir Malevich, Exter, Ivan Kliun, Nadezheva Udaltsova and Olga Rozanova.  Even while identifying as a Suprematist, however, she was more interested in art that served the new communist society.  In 1921, she abandoned painting and turn completely to industrial design.  She designed typography, textiles, clothing, ceramics, posters and ephemera, including covers for the avant-garde magazine Lef.",,,1,"Russian, 1889–1924",,68802431,,,,,,Liubov Popova,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/68802431/,,,,,23424936,23424936

"Mary Cassatt was born in the United States, but was active mostly in France, where she exhibited with the Impressionists. Her favorite subject matter was the social and private lives of women. Cassatt is best known for her images of mothers and children. Her education began at the young age of six. The daughter of a stockbroker, Cassatt was financially stable and was afforded the opportunity of travel and education from a young age. She began her fine art training at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia at age fifteen. Cassatt wanted to become a professional artist despite her parents’ objections. Frustrated with the slow pace of instruction at the Academy, Cassatt decided to study art on her own and in 1866 moved to Paris. As a female artist, she was not permitted to study at the esteemed Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and instead looked to private instruction from masters. She was accepted into Jean-Leon Gerome’s studio, but also frequented the Louvre where she copied works.

During the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), Cassatt moved back to Pennsylvania. She was commissioned by the Archbishop of Chicago, but otherwise, was not successful. In 1871, she went back to France and began exhibiting at the Salon. In 1877, her friend, Edgar Degas invited her to show with the Impressionists.

In 1891, inspired by Japonisme, Cassatt produced a series of drypoint works which met with great success. At this point, her work was much more visible, and Cassatt was seen as a role model by American female artists visiting France. In 1904, France awarded her with the Legion of Honor, the highest award an artist can receive.",,,3,"American, 1844 - 1926",,34624791,,,,,,Mary Cassatt,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/34624791/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"The ubiquitous Swatch watch is manufactured by the Swatch Group, a Swiss conglomerate whose name is derived from a combination of the words “second” and “watch.” The company introduced its first watches in 1983, at a time when digital timepieces were enjoying wide popularity. Intending to re-popularize the analog watch (which first appeared in the 17th century), Swatch developed a range of low-cost, high-tech, artistic and fun quartz-powered wristwatches in bold designs made of bright synthetic materials. Technical innovations included an innovative ultra-sonic welding process, automated assembly, simplified gearing, and a reduced number of components; Swatch was able to decrease the 90 or more components typical in an analog watch to just 51, with no loss in accuracy. 

The first Swatch collection consisted of 12 models and was a resounding success. The company introduced a second collection in 1984 that sold over two million watches. In response to the growing popularity of their timepieces, the company decided to bring out two new collections of 70 models each year, each model chosen for a specific statement in terms of originality, controversy, or interpretation of fashion. Swatches appealed to consumers not only as reliable and low-cost timepieces, but also as collectable fashion statements and design objects. By the late 1980s, the company was commissioning artists and designers, such as Keith Harring and Alessandro Mendini, to create individual watches or entire collections.",,,1,,,34624755,,,,,,Swatch Group,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/34624755/,,,,,23424957,23424957

Michael Eden began his career as a ceramicist in 1981, working in partnership with his wife, Victoria Eden. They set up their first studio in Multum-in-Parvo, Kendal, Cumbria and later relocated to Cumbria in 1987. They worked together to create a variety of traditionally fired ceramic forms, predominantly in slipcast earthenware in addition to lecturing and publishing technical information on the process of their craft. Eden was accepted for an MPhil by the Royal College of Art in 2006, where he was able to experiment with rapid prototyping processes and apply them to expand his practice beyond the limitations of traditional ceramic processes.",,,2,"English, b. 1955",,51688381,,,,,,Michael Eden,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51688381/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"Started by Swiss cutler and surgical equipment-maker, Karl Elsener (1860-1918) in the 1880s, the company was originally called Karl Elsener after its founder, and located in Ibach, Switzerland, where it is still based. In 1891 Elsener won the contract to produce the Modell 1890, a utilitarian folding knife for the Swiss Army. The knife contained not only a blade, but also several tools—a reamer, can-opener, and screwdriver. Elsener controlled the market for these knives until 1893, when another Swiss industrial cutler in the French-speaking region of Jura, Paul Boechat & Cie, later known as the Wenger Company, began selling a similar product. In 1908, the Swiss government divided the contract equally between the two manufacturers. Elsener’s mother died in 1909 and he renamed his company Victoria in her honor. By 1921 the company began using stainless steel, also called “inox,” in its knives; the firm soon combined “Victoria” and “inox” to form the name “Victorinox,” as it is still known today. In 2005, Victorinox acquired Wenger, making it once again the sole supplier of knives to the Swiss Armed Forces.  Elsener used the cross and shield motif on the handles of his knives in the early 1900s, and the logo has been a distinctive feature on Victorinox products from that time to the present.",,,2,Switzerland,,51688355,,,,,,Victorinox,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51688355/,,,,,23424957,23424957

"Levin is an artist, composer, performer and engineer interested in developing artifacts and events that explore new modes of reactive expression. Through performances, digital artifacts, and virtual environments, often created with a variety of collaborators, Levin applies creative twists to digital technologies that highlight our relationship with machines, make visible our ways of interacting with each other, and explore the intersection of abstract communication and interactivity. Levin received undergraduate and graduate degrees from the MIT Media Laboratory, where he studied in the Aesthetics and Computation Group.  Between degrees he worked for four years as an interactions designer and research scientist at Interval Research Corporation in Palo Alto, CA.  Levin is currently Associate Professor of Electronic Time-Based Art at Carnegie Mellon University and since 2009 he has served as Director of CMU’s Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, a laboratory for research across the arts, science, technology, and culture.

"The London-based design studio Wallace Sewell was established by Harriet Wallace-Jones and Emma Sewell after graduating from the Royal College of Art in 1990. Both women trained as weavers, and all of their products are designed by hand on the loom. The specifications are sent to the mill, and the fabrics are  woven on power looms, with careful attention given to maintaining the qualities of a hand-weave. Most of their yarns are sourced from British companies, and are woven in Lancashire. The studio also works with a finisher in Yorkshire.
In addition to their line of fashion and home accessories, Wallace Sewell has created fabrics for the London Underground and Overground trains, Croydon trams and the East London Transit.",,,1,established 1992,,51676709,,,,,,Wallace Sewell,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51676709/,,,,,23424975,23424975

"Named after the city in which it was founded, The Buffalo Pottery Company began as a division of the  Larkin Soap Company, which was housed in a building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.  The Larkin Soap Company needed  to boost soap sales in 1901, so the company put certificates  on soap packages good for soap dishes in return for the coupons.  It succeeded mainly because of the design and quality of the pottery
 Ceramics engineer William Rea, who created the dish model, continued with a line of ceramics including an olive green mix that produced  gradations of color in the finished product, unlike existing pottery. As the soap dish giveaway slowed, in 1903 the Buffalo Pottery Company became the sole distributor of this pottery dubbed Deldare Ware. The Buffalo Pottery Company expanded to include other china related products.  Buffalo launched a commercial business in 1914 by making some of the first vitrified china on the market, created specifically for hotel dining rooms and restaurants.
 The Buffalo Pottery Company is still in business today and it is operating as a division of Oneida, Ltd.",,,1,Founded 1902,,51685783,,,,,,Buffalo Pottery,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51685783/,,,,,23424977,23424977

Jean Leopold Duplan, a French businessman, founded Duplan Silk Company in New York in 1898 as an extension of his silk weaving plant in Lyons, France. The 1897 American tariff spurred Duplan to supply the American silk market with domestically made cloth. Duplan and six other investors funded a small mechanical mill in South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which shortly afterward was relocated to a new building in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. By 1901 the company turned a profit. It was incorporated as the Duplan Silk Corporation in Delaware in 1917.

Jean Duplan constantly sought innovations in silk manufacture. He shifted the plant away from dyeing individual yarns to ""piece dyeing"" the completed woven cloth. By delaying dyeing, Duplan Silk could sell the most current styles and colors of silk without building up an overstock of unfashionable material. Duplan Silk also sold the undyed ""grey"" silk. The staff developed new types of looms that allowed fancy high-twist weaves and crepes.

Duplan Silk began producing artificial silk (now known as rayon) as early as 1911. The lustrous artificial silk was spun from cellulose and a gelatin extracted from seaweed. Duplan himself was quite secretive about the artificial silk production process, keeping the looms in a separate, boarded section of the mill. To curious visitors, he explained his secrecy by claiming, ""In there are skilled Mohammedan women who work without veils, so no men are allowed"" (These Fifty Years, 10). Eventually, Duplan Silk produced silk velvets, formulated its own dyes, and printed fabrics in its own mill.

Jean Duplan sold his controlling interest in the company to the other directors in 1921. Paul C. Debry became Duplan Silk president in 1923, and in 1928 Lehman Brothers (along with Field, Glore & Company and George H. Burr & Company) brokered the deal in which Jean Duplan sold his remaining holdings and brought the corporation to public ownership. In a complex agreement, Jean Duplan sold the remainder of his common stock (26,811 shares at $20 each plus accrued dividends) and preferred stock (12,838 shares at $115 each plus accrued dividends) holdings back to the corporation. Lehman Brothers then issued 20,000 shares of 8 percent cumulative preferred stock at $100 par value per share (worth $2 million total) and 75,000 shares of common stock at $24 per share with no par value.

At the time that Duplan Silk Corporation went public, it operated plants at Hazleton, Kingston, Wilkes-Barre, Nanticoke, and Dorranceton, Pennsylvania. The Hazleton plant had 600,000 square feet of floor space, with 450,000 additional square feet at the other plants. The Hazleton plant alone held 1,675 looms and 144,000 spindles. In 1928 the corporation maintained offices in Paris, London, Lyons, New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Providence, and Charlotte. It supported its 5,000 employees with several vocational schools and a Girls' Club House at Hazleton designed for recreation and personal betterment. Profits in 1927 were $1.35 million, with net tangible assets of $14.5 million.

After Duplan Silk became a public company, it continued to produce silk and rayon, and later nylon. It survived the Great Depression under Paul Debry (president until 1937) and Ernest C. Geier, but closed the Hazleton plant in 1953.

"Jeanne Gang is a graduate of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, and is the founder and principal of Studio Gang Architects (est. 1997), a Chicago-based team of architects, designers, and thinkers whose projects discuss contemporary issues. The work from Studio Gang ranges from private residences to community facilities. The creative thinkers at Studio Gang have produced some of today’s most innovative work that has been inspired by curiosity and intelligence. Gang’s most exemplary work are recent projects, such as the Aqua Tower, which was named Emporis Skyscraper of the Year in 2009, the Northerly Island framework plan, Nature Boardwalk at Lincoln Park Zoo, and Columbia College Chicago’s Media Production Center. 

Studio Gang’s architectural work stems from Jeanne’s breadth of knowledge about architectural forms and concepts, which together create a compelling whole. She seeks design solutions through investigations and collaborations across several disciplines. Her outstanding portfolio has been exhibited internationally, most notably at the International Venice Biennale, MoMA, the National Building Museum, and the Art Institute of Chicago. Jeanne has taught studios at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and IIT, focusing on cities, ecologies, materials, and technologies.",,,18,,,51685685,,,,,,Studio Gang Architects,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51685685/,,,,,23424977,23424977

"Non-Format is a two-person creative direction and communication design firm founded by Kjell Ekhorn (Norwegian, b. 1965) and Jon Forss (British, b.1966).  After meeting in England in the late 1990s, Ekhorn and Forss collaborated on several projects before establishing their own firm EkhornForss Limited in 2001.  The name was soon changed to Non-Format, which the two derived from an article in the popular design magazine Emigre about the future demise of the DVD and the impending “mythical non-format” that would replace it.  While the duo founded the company when they were both living in London, they have since moved an ocean apart and several time zones apart.  Forss has been based in St. Paul, Minnesota since 2007 and Ekhorn has worked from Norway since 2009.  A true twenty-first century design team, the partners spend much of their time collaborating with the aid of the internet, swapping ideas and files and holding meetings via Skype.  Their work has included art direction, design, illustration, and custom typography for commercial clients including Adobe, Coca-Cola, EMI, Gap, IBM, New York Times, Nike, Nokia, Rock Owens, and Sony Music.  Non-Format’s earliest projects were music packaging, and they continue to produce innovative and creative designs in this field, most notably with Lo Recordings, with whom they have worked since Non-Format was founded.  Non-Format has received a number of design awards, including a D&AD Yellow Pencil, two Tokyo TDC Prizes, and a New York ADC Gold.",,,2,,,51676363,,,,,,Non-Format,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51676363/,,,,,,

"from: http://www.ingedusi.cl/english.html

Inge Dusi is a textile artist of German origin, who, except for three years of study in Munich, Germany, lived in Chile until 1974. At that point, she moved to Costa Rica where she lived for another 6 years. Between 1983 and 1997 she resided in Milan, Italy.

Her inspiration comes from her exposure to “amarra”, a technique originally used in Pre-Colombian textiles and internationally recognized nowadys as Shibori. An invitation form th Museum of Contemporary Crafts of New York and a Fullbright Foundation scholarship allowed her to meet important textile artists in th USA. While in Milan, she became part of a group of fiber artists who devoted themselves to applying their art to fashion.  This contact with the italian textile industry and its larg variety of fibers and fabrics has enriched her work and, consequently, it led her to be twice selected as the italian representative to the International Textile Design Contest held by the Fashion Foundation of Tokio, Japan. 

In 1997 she returned to Chile, and along with japanese artist Yoshiko I. Wada, she organized the third International Shibori Symposium at both, the Museum of fine Arts and the Museum of Pre-Colombian Art in Santiago.

The works of Inge Dusi can be found in collections at the Cooper Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts (Smithsonian Institution), and the Jack Lenor Larsen Collection, both in New York; the Amaral Textile Museum in Bogotá, Colombia; and in private collections throughout the United States, Japan, Switzerland, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru and Chile. She has held and participed in exhibitions throughout Latin America, Europe, Japan and the United States.",,,1,,,51676343,,,,,,Inge Dusi (German),,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51676343/,,,,,,

"Catherine Cranston, born in Glasgow in 1849, was a leading figure in the development of tea rooms throughout Glasgow. She founded the Willow Tea Rooms (1894-1904) on Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, and was a major patron of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Mackintosh’s novel aesthetic interiors, including unusual furniture, elaborately stenciled walls and ornate fittings, brought a new era of progressive design to the attention of the Glasgow public and encouraged repeat customers for Miss Cranston in the competitive world of Glasgow tearooms.

"Maria Likarz-Strauss was a very influential designer during her tenure at the Wiener Werkstatte. Extremely prolific, the designer produced nearly 200 designs for the workshop. She is best known for her abstract and geometric patterns. She attended the Applied Arts School between 1911 and 1915. In 1912 she was hired by the Wiener Werkestatte and worked there as a manager until 1932. It is said that her works anticipated the art deco style of the 1920s and 30s.",,,1,"Austrian, 1893–1971",,51685419,,,,,,Maria Likarz-Strauss,,0,0,,,https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/people/51685419/,,,,,23424750,23424750

"London-based Isokon (an acronym for Isometric Unit Construction), was established in 1931 by Jack and Rosemary (Molly) Pritchard and other partners, to design and construct modular houses, apartment buildings, and later, modernist plywood furniture. Another principal in the firm was architect and designer Wells Coates; the company was originally founded in 1929, and called Wells Coates and Partners.  Isokon’s seminal architectural project was the 1934 modernist Lawn Road Flats in Hempstead, sometimes referred to as the Isokon building. In late 1935, the Isokon Furniture Company was established to manufacture and distribute plywood furniture by several designers. Jack Pritchard was initially involved in the firm’s finances, marketing and publicity, but eventually went on to direct the company and hire designers.

""As Pritchard later explained: 'The business was set up in order to exploit the growing demand for modern furniture. Our object was first to establish a good-will for authentic modern furniture at the high price market, and secondly to develop from that position to the mass market.'
Following the original definition of Isokon, he set forth in more formal terms the policies of the new furniture company: 
'The general principal governing the policy will be in the designing, making and distributing of furniture, fittings, and equipment which will help to make contemporary living pleasanter, comfortable, and more efficient. Uniformity in character and design, combined with variety and individuality of each item should be achieved.'""1

After an exhibition of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto’s plywood furniture in London in 1933, Pritchard recognized a large potential market for such furniture in England, and wanted Isokon to manufacture and distribute its own line of modern bent plywood furniture. Pritchard was instrumental in engaging former Bauhaus director and architect Walter Gropius, who had moved to England from Germany in 1935. By 1936, Pritchard had hired  Bauhaus innovator Marcel Breuer, Gropius' friend and also a recent émigré, to design Isokon’s first plywood chairs. The company ceased production in 1939, at the onset of World War II, when its supply of plywood was cut off.

"Both a manufacturer and brand, Plus Minus Zero was co-founded by industrial designer Naoto Fukasawa in Japan in 2003, with the idea to design products that do not raise people’s expectations about function directly through design, but improve the quality of the users lives in a more general way. The brand name seems to refer to the concept of creating design that is just right, that is complete only when nothing can be added or subtracted to improve it. The brand focuses on small household appliances and electronics, but has also produced tableware and items like the Sole Bag, a simple white tote made to rest firmly on the ground, its bottom designed as the treaded sole of a shoe. Ignoring sylistic trends, Plus Minus Zero designs are characterized by minimalism and attention to detail, and can display the designer's subtle sense of humor as well.
