    "biography": "Schira received her BFA from RISD, studied at L\u2019Ecole d\u2019Art Decoratif in France, and later got her MFA from the University of Kansas. She traveled around the world, including India, Japan, Virgin Islands and Europe. Schira became interested in Peruvian textiles because the techniques used were nothing like European traditions. In the 1960s and 70s she began experimenting with ikat dyed warp designs, then with weaving strips of aluminum through her works, combining them with fiber warp. In 1973, she began experimenting again, this time using rayon ribbon and pre-dyed tapes. Although she incorporates all these materials, she is still true the traditional technique of flat tapestry hanging. Several public spaces own her large scale tapestries.",
