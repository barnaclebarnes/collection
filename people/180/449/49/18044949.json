    "biography": "Hilda Jesser studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule for Women and Girls (School of Applied Arts) in Vienna from 1914-17 first in the general course under architect Oskar Strnad and, in 1915 in the architecture program under Josef Hoffmann, where she concentrated on textile and fashion design. She started working at the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte in 1916 where she continued until 1922 under director Dagobert Peche.  There, she proved to be one of their most versatile artists, designing works in a variety of media, including ceramics, commerical graphics, embroidery, glass, ivory, lace, lamps, leather, metalwork, postcards, toys, and wall paintings.   She was especially noted for her painting skills, however, she produced only a small selection of ceramic designs. Her rare ceramic works generally share a deliberate limited coloration and decoration, but often with innovative glazes, and a special emphasis on function. Jesser assumed a teaching role at the Kunstgewerbeschule in 1922, and became a full professor in 1935. While forced to stop teaching by the Nazis in 1938, she resumed her position there in 1945.",
