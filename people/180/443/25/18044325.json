    "biography": "Born in Copenhagen, Jens Risom studied furniture design and worked in the design department of Sweden\u2019s largest department store, Nordiska Kompaniet, before immigrating to the United States in 1939. \n\nRisom became acquainted with Hans Knoll while working for an interior designer and joined Knoll in 1941 to design furniture and oversee fabrication, mainly for commissions by architects and private clients. Determined to expand his business, Knoll assembled Risom\u2019s designs as a featured collection in the company\u2019s first catalog, published in 1942. The product line exhibited the company\u2019s design direction: wood furnishings in a modern idiom. Wartime material shortages did not constrain Risom\u2019s creativity but rather fostered experimentation and resourcefulness: he used material that had been rejected by the government as substandard for military use, but proved quite suitable for residential seating. This can be seen in the use of webbing in place of traditional upholstery on many of Risom\u2019s chairs, and in the use of \u201cregulated\u201d (soft) wood for furniture frames.",
