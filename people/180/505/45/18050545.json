    "biography": "The Boston and Sandwich Glass Company, located in Sandwich, Massachusetts, was a top innovative producer of high quality glass in the second half of the 19th century. In 1825, Deming Jarvis started the Boston and Sandwich Glass Company in a small town on Cape Cod that was rich in fuel, had easy access to major waterways, and was located only 50 miles from Boston. Boats could dock at the plant, which facilitated the transport of goods. Despite its seaside location, Sandwich lacked fine sand, so sand was brought in from New Jersey and Western Massachusetts. Sandwich went out of business in 1888 due to labor disputes with newly-formed unions\u2014an ironic twist as the firm had provided more worker benefits throughout its history than many other companies.",
