    "biography": "Louis Sullivan (American, 1956-1924) was one of the most significant  American architects of any era. His work provides a transition from the nineteenth century academic world to the twentieth century. Like his teacher and mentor, Henry Hobson Richardson he considered the decorative elements of his buildings with a particularly keen sense of the aesthetic movement tempered with a strong architectural rationalism.  The Chicago Stock exchange of 1893 was one of Adler (Dankmar) and Sullivan's major commissions, showing a modern aesthetic when compared with the more Beaux Arts styles of some of the buildings at the contemporary World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.",
