    "biography": "A potter and a porcelain painter, Dalpayrat was born in Limoges in 1844, and went to the School of Drawing and the Municipal School of Painting on Chinaware, after which he worked in Limoges and Monte Carlo. He established his workshop in Bourg-la-Reine in 1889, with his wife and three (later four) sons. He specialized in stoneware with high-temperature flamb\u00e9 glaze and perfected a copper oxide red glaze that became known as \"Dalpayrat red,\" which he combined with yellows along with rich greens, blues and purples to achieve a marbled effect. This brought him considerable attention at the 1892 salon, and in 1893 he won a gold medal at the Chicago International Exhibition. He went on to make highly acclaimed pieces, some of them set with silver by Parisian jewelers like Cardeihac and Keller, and some of his work for Bing was further decorated with bronze mounts by Edouard Colonna. In 1906, Dalpayrat's workshop closed for financial reasons. He died four years later.",
