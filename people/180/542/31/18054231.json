    "biography": "Tanadori Yokoo is widely considered one of the most important Japanese graphic designers to emerge following World War II. Yokoo began his career as a stage designer for avant-garde theater in Tokyo. His early work reflects the influence of Milton Glaser and Seymour Chwast of Push Pin Studios. Yokoo began producing posters in the mid-1960s. Originally trained as a painter, he selected iconic elements from both western and eastern art to create a visual dialogue representing the synthesis of East and West. At a time when American pop artists, such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, were mining commercial art, commenting on mass production, and revitalizing the relevance of fine art in society, Yokoo created his own conversation between mass production and fine art. \n\nBy the late 1960s, Yokoo became interested in mysticism and psychedelia, which was deepened by a trip to India. While his multilayered graphic work somewhat resembles that of American and English psychedelic graphic designers, his imagery is intensely autobiographical and highly original. Yokoo achieved international recognition demonstrated through his inclusion in the 1968 Word and Image exhibition at MoMA. Four years later, MoMA mounted a monographic exhibition of his work. This was followed by other solo exhibitions at the Museen f\u00fcr Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg (1973) and the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam (1974). In 1981, Yokoo gave up commercial work to concentrate on painting, which he continues today along with graphic design.",
