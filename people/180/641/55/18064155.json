Although his first design job in New York with the Knoll Planning Unit lasted only two years (1950\u201352) he maintained a close relationship with Eszter Haraszty, then director of the Knoll Textiles department. Herbert went on to have a long and productive career as a textile and interior designer. His designs were produced by L. Anton Maix and Arundell Clark before he opened his own firm, Albert Herbert Designs, in 1957.",
