    "biography": "Julie Mihalisin studied jewelry at Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia and received her MFA from the Royal College of Art in London. She developed a personal style.  In 1990 she built her own studio for glass and metal production. Mihalisin uses goldsmithing, enameling and glassmaking techniques to create her objects, casting or grinding the glass. Then she works fits the metal to the glass fusing them together. Her glass seems to ooze out of the metal, giving it a unique movement. Mihalisin has exhibited and received several awards.",
