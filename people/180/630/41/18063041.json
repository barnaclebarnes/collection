    "biography": "Thomas Eyck is a self-proclaimed \u201cdesign publisher.\u201d The centerpiece of Eyck\u2019s career is his fascination with materials, an interest he gained after years in the design world. Eyck received his M.A. in Art and Design from the University of Utrecht in 1991 and served on the Board of Management at ceramics manufactory Royal Tichelaar Makkum for almost seven years. Since founding a design firm that bears his name in 2007, Eyck has established a growing collection of products by a hand-selected contingent of Dutch designers. Before he selects the designers, Eyck chooses one specific material to shape the identity of the design. He then mediates the relationship between designer and manufacturer, manipulating the design process to investigate each material\u2019s potential. Eyck\u2019s list of collaborators includes Hella Jongerius, Irma Boom, RaR, Studio Job and Aldo Bakker. Eyck also works as a curatorial consultant at the Zuiderzeemuseum in Enkhuiszen, Netherlands.\n\nhttp:\/\/thomaseyck.com\/about-te\nhttp:\/\/www.stylepark.com\/en\/news\/out-of-love-for-materials\/334163\nhttp:\/\/www.dwell.com\/design-source\/org\/thomas-eyck",
