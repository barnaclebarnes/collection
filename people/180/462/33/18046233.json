    "biography": "Maria Mundal was born in Norway. She learned tapestry weaving from her mother, a common Norwegian practice that is passed down from mother to daughter. Mundal produced home goods along with the rest of the women of the family, such as bedding, warm clothing and rugs. However, what she valued most were tapestries, which she deemed things of beauty.  \nShe and her husband, artist Mons Breidvik, with his seven children, moved to the United States in 1927. Too busy with her family to produce any tapestries, she did not open a studio until after WWII. By then she had already divorced and was working in Brooklyn. \nMundal\u2019s tapestries recall folk legends, myths and poetry. She was also a poet and translated famous English poems into Norwegian and vice-versa.",
