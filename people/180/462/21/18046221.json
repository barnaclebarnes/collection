    "biography": "In 1957 weaver and artist Anni Albers began her lengthy association with Knoll Textiles acting as a consultant on a line of new textiles, which included a series of casement fabrics. These fabrics are typical of Albers work during her years as a student and teacher at the Bauhaus, as well as her later work in the United States where she and her husband, Josef Albers, emigrated in 1933 to teach at Black Mountain College (1933-49). The design of these casement fabrics recalls her entirely functional approach to textiles with an ongoing curiosity about and experimentation with new fibers and techniques.",
