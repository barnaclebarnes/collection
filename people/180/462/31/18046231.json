She trained under Swedish master weavers, and traveled to France and Italy; then moved to New York City where she trained at Flambeau Weavers. In 1921, she opened a studio with Beatrice V. Abbott called Snow-Abbott Looms and later called Snow Looms School of Weaving and Crafts. Snow was interested in using weaving as a therapeutic aid; she collaborated with doctors to help patients with psychological illnesses. She published a book, Weaving Lessons for Hand Looms, in 1947.",
