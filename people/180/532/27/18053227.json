In 1978, Trudy graduated from Tyler School of Art and and then attended Philadelphia College of Art.  She worked as a jewelry designer in Philadelphia and New York, at small jewelry companies and at large ones, including Cartier, Inc. and David Yurman. Her works tend to be playful creating a dialogue between the shape of the object and its literal meaning.",
