    "biography": "Marianne was born in Finland and went to the Central School of Industrial Design in Helsingfors. In 1930, she worked with her mother, Anna Wegelius, director at Hemflit-Kotiahkeruus. Invited by friend Eliel Saarinen to teach at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in 1937, she eventually became head of the Department of Weaving and Textile Design. During her 25 years at Cranbrook, she was commissioned a number of times by architects and designers, including Eero Saarinen. Marianne is best known for her use of synthetic fabrics that were especially desirable among major American companies, such as automotive corporations and airlines.\nShe collaborated with her husband, architect Olav Hammarstrom, designing interiors and textiles. Together they developed a new loom that could accommodate wider widths of fabric. \nMarianne had dozens of solo exhibitions throughout her life. She began donating her works in 1983 to museums around the world.",
