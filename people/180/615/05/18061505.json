    "biography": "Hechizoo Textiles, which creates custom textiles for upholstery, rugs, window treatments and paneling, was founded in 2000 by Jorge Lizarazo in Bogota, Colombia. Lizarazo originally worked as an architect, which has influenced his textiles in terms of their structural clarity and use of materials. His designs also benefit from his staff\u2019s diverse expertise in the rich weaving traditions of various regions in South America. Additionally, the staff is trained to work with new and unusual materials that complement the often understated and basic textile structure of the textiles. Hechizoo textiles incorporate both man-made materials, such as metal wire, nylon, and polyester ribbon, with natural materials such as, silk, agave, cumare and penca. The integration of these natural fibers with more industrial products results in the creation of contemporary and sophisticated products.",
