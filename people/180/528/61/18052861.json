    "biography": "Adelgunde \u201cGunta\u201d St\u00f6lzl was a very significant and prolific German weaver who was instrumental in shifting the focus of the Bauhaus weaving workshops from pictorial works to industrial-ready designs. Her textiles are renowned for their color, their abstract and asymmetrical composition, and their incorporation of new materials.\n\nSt\u00f6lzl studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich prior to entering the Bauhaus in 1919. At the Bauhaus, her courses with Paul Klee influenced her bright and lively color palette and the horizontally-aligned compositions that she would use in her woven art of the 1920s and 30s. By 1925, she was appointed craft master of the weaving workshop, which she ran with Georg Muche; she became the master of the weaving workshop upon Muche\u2019s departure in 1927. Due to mounting political pressure, St\u00f6lzl was asked to step down in 1931. She moved to Zurich where she continued weaving, founding S P H Stoffe with fellow Bauhaus students Gertrude Preiswerk and Heinrich-Otto H\u00fcrlimann. After the departure of H\u00fcrlimann in 1937, she ran the workshop under the name Handweberei Flora (Flora Handweaving Mill). The company existed for 30 years, after which St\u00f6lzl continued weaving independently until her death.",
