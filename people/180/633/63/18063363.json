    "biography": "Brothers and designers, Ronan (b. 1971) and Erwan (b. 1976) Bouroullec, were born and raised in Quimper, France. During their studies at the \u00c9cole Nationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris and at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Cergy-Pontoise, they collaborated in several independent design projects. In 1999, they officially joined as partners and established their own design firm. Ronan and Erwan\u2019s collaboration is enriched by their distinct hard-working personalities and shared aspirations for producing high-quality, balanced design. They have created comprehensive collections that range from small domestic objects (vases, porcelain, dishware, jewelry, and other accessories), office and home furniture, to larger interior and architectural projects. Their aesthetic can be defined as \u201cpoetic and practical\u201d because their designs provide a variety of solutions and customization.  \n\nIn 1997, they were acknowledged by Giulio Cappellini who presented their first industrial design projects: the Closed Bed and the Spring Chair.  In the early 2000s, the brothers worked with Issey Miyake in designing interior spaces, Vitra in creating a new office system, Kvadrat in making textile wall systems, and with Magis in designing two extensive furniture collections. They continue to work with these manufacturers, as well as with Herman Miller, Kartell, Established and Sons, Ligne Roset, Axor, Alessi, Mattiazzi, Flos, Mutina, Hay, and Iittala. \n\nTheir awards include Designers of the Year at the Salon du Meuble (2002) and The Danish Design Award in Copenhagen (2010).  A number of their objects have been showcased or acquired by design museums, most notably the Victoria and Albert Museum, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Design Museum in London, the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris, and Cooper Hewitt. The Centre Pompidou, Metz, gave them their first monographic exhibition, Ronan & Erwan Bouroullec, Bivouac (2011-12).",
