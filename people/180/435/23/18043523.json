    "biography": "Ladislav Sutnar, a Bohemian painter and an advertising, display, and industrial designer, was an innovator in the field of information design and information graphics.

His graphic design vocabulary, based on Constructivism and geometry, employed functional typography, limited color palettes, and layout frameworks to facilitate searching, scanning, and reading. Sutnar was also one of the most notable industrial and exhibition designers of the 1930s. His most important industrial designs of that era include a glass drinking set (1930-1932), a china table set (1928-1932), and cutlery. Sutnar\u2019s designs for heat-resistant glass cups, tea sets, and containers (1931), produced by Sch\u00f6ne Stube in Prague, were among the first applications of the material for home use. \n\nSutnar immigrated to the United States in 1939, shortly after arriving for the New York World\u2019s Fair as the chief designer of the Czechoslovak Hall in the Czech pavilion. Sutnar subsequently embarked upon a prolific career in typography, packaging, advertising and exhibition design. From 1941 to 1960, he was the art director, coordinator and designer for F.W. Dodge\u2019s Sweet\u2019s Catalog Service, a company that produced annually-updated catalogs of industrial and architectural products. In 1960, after leaving Sweet\u2019s, Sutnar began a series of \u201cVenus\u201d paintings and prints, which featured prototypes of American woman in executed in a flat, graphic style with bold colors. \n\nSutnar concurrently studied painting at the School of Applied Arts, mathematics at the Czech Technical University and architecture at Charles University, in Prague. He later taught design at the State School for Graphic Arts in Prague, In the United States, Sutnar also served as the art director of Theatre Arts Magazine.
