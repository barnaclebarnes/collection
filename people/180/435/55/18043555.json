    "biography": "Dorothy Draper was an interior decorator who wrote the 1939 book, Decorating is Fun! How to be Your Own Decorator. She came from a wealthy family and married Dr. George Draper, who became Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s person doctor. Although she was not schooled, she was educated by her wealthy surroundings. Draper is best known for creating the Modern Baroque style, which uses bright colors, bold prints, and a modern take on classical styles. In 1918, Draper decorated her own home, and after receiving many compliments and encouragements, she decided to launch a career out of her passion. In 1925, she opened the Architectural Clearing House. Consequently, she was commissioned to redecorate the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan, the Fairmont and the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco, and later came other important hotels all over the country.",
