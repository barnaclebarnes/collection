Afterwards, in 1993, she became interested in furniture and designed her first collection with Lynne Leegte. In 1998 she founded Brunklaus Amsterdam, withdrew her products from the wholesale market, and began self-producing, preferring to keep her production small so that she can experiment freely and avoid the compromises of commercial production.",
