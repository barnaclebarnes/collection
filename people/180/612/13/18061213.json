    "biography": "Thomas Demand is an internationally known photographer from Germany who has a unique approach to his work. Although the imagery in his photographs appears to be real, it is actually a recreation of a scene using torn paper and cardboard. Demand usually works with an image culled from the media and then reconstructs the scene in a life-size three-dimensional format. His reconstructions are very detailed\u2014he even simulates the texture of the source materials. Demand\u2019s work challenges the notion of photography as being an unbiased glimpse of reality. Things are not what they seem in Demand\u2019s work. After the model is photographed, the paper and cardboard is destroyed.\n\nDemand studied at the Staatliche Kunstakademie in D\u00fcsseldorf and at Goldsmiths College in London. He originally studied sculpture and later pursued photography. In 1993, he began joining these two media by constructing the scenes he wished to photograph. Many of the images Demand chooses to recreate and capture in his photographs are of violent or grim situations. Acts of violence, however, are absent. The images may initially appear innocent, but there is usually a darker side. Demand\u2019s photographs are held by museum collections including the Guggenheim, the Tate Gallery and the Carnegie Museum of Art",
