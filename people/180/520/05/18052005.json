    "biography": "Born The Hague 10\/4\/1885; died 1989\n\nDutch architect and graphic designer Hendrikus Wijdeveld  was an important force in the creation of Dutch modernist design. As an architect, he was a member of the expressionist movement that opposed the De Stijl group. As a graphic designer, he founded and edited the innovative Dutch periodical Wendingen (published between 1918 and 1931), for which he designed most of the covers and layouts. Cooper-Hewitt\u2019s library holds many issues of Wendingen. Wijdeveld\u2019s characteristic bold, decorative, block-like typeforms and ornamental borders, which became known as the \u201cWendingen style,\u201d influenced Dutch graphic design well into the 1940s. Wijdeveld also designed posters, some of which have become icons in graphic design history.",
