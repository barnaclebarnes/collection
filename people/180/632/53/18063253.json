    "biography": "Graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Occidental College in 1937, and from Harvard Divinity School in 1940.  His interest in pottery began at Harvard when he took a course in Chinese and Japanese art.  He became especially interested in Chinese Sung Dynasty ceramics, paticularly the celedon glazes (blues and greens) and the ox-blood glazes.  Kring kept up his \"hobby\" throughout his ministries.  A trip to Japan in 1953 furthered his passion for Asian glazes.  He was an active member of the New York Society of Ceramic Arts, and his pottery was shown in American museums from the time (1946-1955) of his Worcester ministry.",
