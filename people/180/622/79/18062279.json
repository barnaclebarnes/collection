The architecture and design practice he founded in 1984, Rockwell Group, has received numerous design awards, including the 2008 National Design Award in the field of Interior Design and the 2001 Presidential Award for the Grand Central Terminal restoration and renovation. One of the hallmarks of Rockwell interiors is the unexpected mix of textures, patterns, and materials used to create an environment or evoke an emotional response.",
