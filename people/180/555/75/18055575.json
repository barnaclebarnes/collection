    "biography": "Alpha Workshops is the only non-profit organization in the country that trains people living with HIV for work in the field of decorative arts.  The workshop began production in 1995.  They do faux painting, gilding, decorative objects, wallpapers and textiles.  This past summer Alpha artisans were responsible for painting the faux marble and faux bois on the walls, floors and stairways of Gracie Mansion.  Their fabrics and wallpapers are sold through the Pollack showroom in the D&D Building.  Many of the Alpha Workshop trainees are hired to work in their studio.  Alpha staff carve the blocks and print the papers in their studio.  Many of the designs are printed on hand-painted backgrounds.   \n\nThe Alpha Workshops wallpapers have been featured in Elle D\u00e9cor, House Beautiful and Country Living magazines. Their wallpapers were recently nominated for an International Design Award by Elle D\u00e9cor magazine.  They were chosen as the top talent in home design in the category of wall coverings.",
