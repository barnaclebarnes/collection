    "biography": "William H. Bradley's Chicago-based publication, The Chap-Book, was considered to be the American public\u2019s introduction to art nouveau style and the British Arts and Crafts movement. He was especially influenced by Aubrey Beardsley\u2019s sophisticated illustrations for The Yellow Book, a journal of art and literature first published in London in  April 1894. Like Beardsley, Bradley relied on breaking the compositional rectangle into a series of dominant and subdominant lines, filling in areas with flat expanses of one or two colors.\n\nBradley illustrated covers for Collier's Weekly (for which he served as art editor from 1907\u201310), Scribner\u2019s Magazine, and Harper\u2019s.",
