    "biography": "The self-taught textile artist emigrated from Budapest to New York City at the age of 16. She began as a clothing designer for women and children. After World War II, Americans began looking toward more folk and local aesthetics, such as Western and Native American motifs. With Karasz\u2019s interest in her native Hungarian folk traditions, she began creating embroidered wall hangings in that manner. The new \u201cMade in America\u201d mentality that developed after the war also encouraged many crafts people to revive the art. \nAfter a successful book, \u201cAdventures in Stitches: A New Art of Embroidery,\u201d published in 1949, Karasz went on to guest edit at House Beautiful and is credited as reviving domestic embroidery in the 1950s.",
