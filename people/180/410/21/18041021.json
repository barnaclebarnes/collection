Farber considered many kitchen tools to be \u201cfunctional disasters\u201d and contemplated what could be done for his wife and the more than 20 million Americans with arthritis.[1] He noted that, even for the average user, \u201cordinary kitchen tools hurt your hands, with painful scissor loops... [and] hard skinny handles.\u201d[2] Farber wondered: if you made comfortable tools, wouldn\u2019t everybody use them?\n\n\n[1] Corporate Design Foundation, \"Getting a Grip on Kitchen Tools,\" @issue Journal 2, no. 1 (1996), http:\/\/www.cdf.org\/issue_journal\/getting_a_grip_on_kitchen_tools.html\n[2] Ibid.",
