    "biography": "1n 1997, Bowness graduated from Leeds College of Art & Design, where she studied surface pattern and textile design; then received her MA from the Royal College of Art in constructed textiles. Wanting her art to be functional, Bowness introduced a different approach to art. For her first wallpaper, she photographed hanging dresses and made a montage of them, then made lifesized digital prints, adding colorful silkscreened details. Her other famous work is the \u201cGenuine Fake Bookshelf,\u201d which she produced in 2002. It depicts life-size bookshelves filled with books. Bowness has been commissioned by major brands, such as Polydor, Lacroix, and Reebok. She designs some of her work in St. Leonards, on the southern coast of England; her factory is located near York, north England.",
