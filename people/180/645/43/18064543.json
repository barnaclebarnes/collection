Von Nessen utilized the studio to produce lighting for the most part, but also created tableware, furniture and appliance designs. When Von Nessen died in 1943, his wife Greta briefly closed the firm. She reopened Nessen Studios after WWII and resumed the production of lamps, adding lighting designs of her own to its oeuvre. Nessen Studios is still in business today under the name Nessen Lighting, Inc. It is now located in Mamaroneck, New York.  \n\nhttp:\/\/whoagirl.tumblr.com\/post\/6768904331\/babes-of-the-month-to-those-without-histories\nhttp:\/\/www.nessenlighting.com\/wnessen.php\nhttp:\/\/www.nessenlighting.com\/about.php",
