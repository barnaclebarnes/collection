    "biography": "Emerson Radio Corp. was incorporated in 1915 by Victor Hugo Emerson. Though based in New York City, the company's first factories were opened in Chicago and Boston, in 1920. The company expanded in the 20's and was thus renamed the Emerson Radio and Phonograph Corp. Although Emerson introduced the first radio-phonograph combination sold in the United States, the company remained in obscurity until 1932, when, during the Great Depression, it introduced the \"peewee\" radio. The company would later be one of the first to successfully market consumer televisions. \n\nThe Emerson Radio and Phonograph Corp. is particularly notable as the manufacturer of the red, white and blue \"Patriot\" radio, designed by Norman Bel Geddes.",
