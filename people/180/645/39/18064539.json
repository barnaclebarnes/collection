    "biography": "Revere Copper and Brass, Inc. was originally started by Paul Revere in 1801 as he worked to reduce the young United States\u2019 dependence on England for rolled copper sheets, which were important for sheathing the hulls of ships. After intensive trial and error and research on copper rolling techniques, Revere became the first American to roll copper successfully. Copper rolled at his mill was used to protect the hull of \u201cOld Ironsides\u201d and cover the dome of the Massachusetts State House. Mergers in 1928 and 1929 led Revere\u2019s original copper mill, Revere Copper, in Canton, Massachusetts to be renamed Revere Copper and Brass, Inc. and relocated to Rome, New York. In 1938, an employee of the Revere Cooper and Brass, Inc. named James M. Kennedy invented copper-clad cookware, now called Revere Ware. The company continues to do business today, having returned to the name Revere Copper.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.reverecopper.com\/about-us\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Revere_Copper_Company",
