    "biography": "Judith Brown is best known for her figural sculptures. Born in New York City, she attended Sarah Lawrence College, where she studied sculpture under Abstract Expressionist Theodore Roszak. From him, Brown learned how to weld. She opened a studio in Reading, Vermont, where she would collect scrap metal to use in her objects. Brown loved dance, and had been a dancer herself, so when she created her figures, they usually embraced the motion and immediacy of a dancer\u2019s body.  During her travels throughout Europe, Brown sketched Classical and Renaissance works.  She was commissioned to design window displays for a variety of different stores, including Tiffany & Co. Throughout her career Brown exhibited widely and received several awards for her innovative designs.",
