As Donald Albrecht wrote in his 2001 Cooper Hewitt exhibition, \"Russel Wright: Creating American Lifestyle,\" Wright\u2019s \u201cinexpensive, mass produced dinnerware, furniture, appliances, and textiles were not only visually and technically innovative but were also the tools to achieve his concept of \u2018easier living\u2019, a unique American lifestyle that was gracious yet contemporary and informal.\u201d The Cooper-Hewitt has over one hundred works in the collection by Wright, from a design drawing for flatware to extensive examples from his American Modern line of tableware and serving accessories.",
