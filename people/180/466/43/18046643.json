    "biography": "Peggy Angus saw art as something that all should enjoy. In 1922, she enrolled at the Royal College of Art, where she studied design from Paul Nash, whose style was deeply rooted in English tradition. Upon graduation, Peggy began teaching in Nuneaton, where she also explored social realism in her artwork. In 1933, she moved to Sussex where she rented a cottage that would become the central meeting place for all her friends and colleagues. Architects, artists, designers, and thinkers of the day met there making it a wonderfully creative environment for all involved.\nPeggy\u2019s social leanings were apparent in her work and she became known as \u201cRed Angus\u201d for her visit to Russia and her illustrations in The Daily Worker and the Labour Party. She was teaching at North London Collegiate School, when the linocut designs she had her students make for tiles were noticed by architect FRS Yorke. She eventually was commissioned by Heathrow Airport, which was newly constructed. \nPeggy established her hand-blocked wallpaper design practice in 1960. She produced bold and colorful designs that she preferred over machine-made papers.",
