Their careers paved the way for later professional Canadian craftspeople. They opened their studio in 1935 and worked until Kjeld\u2019s death in 1963. While Erica studied in Denmark, Kjeld purchased a farm in New Brunswick.  The couple then returned to Denmark where Kjeld learned rudimentary pottery making and Erica studied weaving.
