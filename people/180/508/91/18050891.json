    "biography": "Born at Great Marlow, Joseph Nash began his drafting career studying Gothic architecture under Augustus Charles Pugin. He went with Pugin to Paris in 1829 to make drawings for Paris and Its Environs (1830), and lithographed the plates in Pugin\u2019s Views Illustrative of Examples of Gothic Architecture (1830). From 1831 to 1879, he exhibited at the Royal Academy; and exhibited at the 1855 Paris Exposition Universelle, receiving an honorable mention. His early exhibits at the Society of\nPainters in Water Colours were mainly illustrations for Shakespeare and contemporary poetry and novels; Tudor and Elizabethan architecture of Knole, Hampton Court, and Speke Hall were also frequent subjects. His published works\ninclude Architecture of the Middle Ages (1838); The Mansions of England in the\nOlden Time, published in four sets of twenty-six lithographs (1839\u201349); Scotland\nDelineated (1847\u201354); and Views of Windsor Castle (1848).
