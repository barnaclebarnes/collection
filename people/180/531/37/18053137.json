    "biography": "The New England Glass Company made a large variety of glassware, from pocket bottles and tumblers to art glass, using a range of techniques including molding, mechanical pressing, cutting, and engraving. It produced some of the finest blown glass in the United States, competitive with European examples. The glass had a high lead content, simple outlines, and was carefully finished. The firm was also famous for its rich colors, especially ruby red and the amberina range, a blended colored glass in which the lower part, a yellowish amber, merges into a ruby-red color higher up. An example of American technological innovation, the amberina technique was patented by the New England Glass Company in 1883.\n\nThe New England Glass Company was located in East Cambridge, Massachusetts, from about 1818 until 1888, when a strike forced its closing. Rather than go out of business, however, the company\u2019s owner, Edward D. Libbey, moved the factory to Toledo, Ohio, where it still exists as the Libbey-Owens Ford Company.",
