    "biography": "Max Bill, a Swiss painter, sculptor, and designer, is one of the seminal figures in 20th-century Swiss graphic design and typography. Bill is most famous for his graphic interpretation of Bauhaus and constructivist ideals. His designs from the mid-1930s for the Zurich Kunstgewerbemuseum show his application of geometric forms and an ordered compositional layout directly inspired by the graphic and typographical innovations of Herbert Bayer, his mentor at the Bauhaus from 1927 to 1929. \n\nBill studied at the Zurich Kunstgewerbeschule from 1924 to 1927 and at the Bauhaus in Dessau from 1927 to 1929. Bill returned to Zurich in 1929, where he became instrumental in the development of the constructivist ideal in Swiss graphic design. He was the co founder and director of the Ulm School of Arts and Crafts (1931\u201356), an institution dedicated \u201cto improve the quality, form and functionality of commodities made in Germany.\u201d[1] Bill was also the head architect of the Building and Design Sectors for the Swiss National Exhibit in Lausanne (1961\u201364) and was a professor at the State School for Fine Arts in Hamburg in 1967.\n\n[1] Deed of donation, 1953.",
