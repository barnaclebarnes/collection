He produced custom designs for interior decorators and his many private clients. Parzinger furnishings changed very little over the years. Rooted in Viennese style, the main characteristics of the furniture were simplicity and a sense of proportion, rich wood textures ornamented with handmade hardware. His designs for silver, ceramics, lighting and glassware used light and joyful animal or floral motifs. In 1996 and 1998 his work was shown by Palumbo Gallery, 972 Lexington Avenue, New York City.",
