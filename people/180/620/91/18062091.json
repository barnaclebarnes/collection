He is documented to have provided cartoons for the borders, overwindows and supplements for a set of tapestries for the reception rooms near the bedchamber of Charles of Bourbon, King of Naples at the Reggia di Caserta.  These were executed under the direction of Giuseppe Bonito, painter to the Neopolitan court, at the San Carlo al Mortelle (Neopolitan royal manufactory).  The tapestries are now distributed between the Capodimonte Museum and Gallery in Naples, and the Quirinal in Rome.",
