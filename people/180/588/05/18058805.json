    "biography": "Hitoshi Ujiie, was born in Kyoto, Japan, and worked in his family's textile business, is a textile designer as well as educator and founder of the Center for Excellence in Digital Inkjet Printing at Philadelphia University. He received a B.F.A from Kyoto Seika University in Japan and a M.F.A from the University of Georgia. Ujiie\u2019s work is an exploration of the aesthetic implications of digital inkjet printing for textiles, which is bringing about profound changes in the approach to design for this medium. \nWorking from photographic and video sources combined with hand manipulation, Ujiie exploits the full range of effects that can be achieved by digital technology, yet his work maintains a profoundly delicate aesthetic. Digital technology permits a fineness of line not previously possible due to the higher \u201cresolution\u201d of inkjet vs. screen technology. It also eliminates the need for repeat in textile design, and Ujiie turns his attention instead to a sense of movement without repetition.",
