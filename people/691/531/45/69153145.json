    "biography": "\"Louis Dalbet was running a family ironwork business. Jean and Andr\u00e9, his two sons, worked alongside four other employees. Louis Dalbet trained at the Robert workshop. Around 1912, he had worked as a journeyman around France and then set up on his own. He opened a workshop at 4 bis, Rue Capron specializing in decorative wrought-iron work. Concentrating on railings, banisters, and fireguards, he also did all the ironwork for the well-known Brasserie Bofinger. From time to time, he would design items and exhibit at the Salon d'Automne. In 1917, he was awarded the Prix de Rome for a gate he designed. A year after his meeting with Pierre Chareau in 1923, their collaboration was well under way. He was Chareau's own choice and was the only ironworker to work with him from then on.\"\n\nMarc Vellay, Kenneth Frampton, Pierre Chareau, Architect and Craftsman, 1883-1950, New York, Rizzoli, 1984; p144.",
