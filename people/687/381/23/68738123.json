In 1999, Joris Maltha and Daniel Gross founded Catalogtree while enrolled in Werkplaats Typographie, a two-year graphic design program in Arnhem, Netherlands. Their systematic approach to organizing information produces data that is graphic and imagery that is information. The designers are drawn to large data sets, which lend themselves to myriad interpretations.",
