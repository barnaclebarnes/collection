He returned to Berlin after 1813\nand studied painting at the K\u00f6nigliche Porzellanmanufaktur, where he stayed\nuntil approximately 1821. Gaertner became an assistant in the studio of theatrical\nscene painter Karl Wilhelm Gropius (1793\u20131870) and worked as a painter of\nstage sets. He first exhibited at the Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste, Berlin. In\n1824\u201325, he was commissioned to paint interior views of the Berlin Cathedral and\nthe chapel of the Schloss Charlottenburg. He spent three years in Paris, where he\nstudied under Jean-Victor Bertin (1767\u20131842), and later mounted an exhibition at\nthe Berlin Akademie of works he had completed there. This exhibition greatly increased his visibility, and King Wilhelm III of Prussia acquired several of his works.
