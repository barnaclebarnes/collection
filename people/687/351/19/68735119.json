    "biography": "Felix Pf\u00e4ffli is a young Swiss designer based in Lucerne whose posters are an arresting amalgam of precision and pop. They command attention with vivid colors and inventive, geometric type. Pf\u00e4ffli\u2019s interest in graphic design began in high school, when he started creating posters and brochures for a local concert house. In this capacity, he received a practical education in design fundamentals, from composition and technique to digital modes of production. Since then, he has gravitated toward the poster format, which he favors precisely for its limitations; he has explained that its size restrictions engender discipline and economy of design.\nPf\u00e4ffli\u2019s largest project to date is an ongoing series of posters for S\u00fcdpol, a Swiss cultural center and arts space. He has also designed magazine covers, record sleeves, and posters for Herman Miller, AGI, and the Graphic Design Festival in Breda, among others. His typographical experiments have yielded one animated project for Wired Magazine, and another for the largest LED screen in the world. His work has appeared in exhibitions such as Chaumont Design Graphique (2014), 100 Years of Swiss Graphic Design (2012), 100 Best Posters 2011, and the 2011 China International Poster Biennial. Pf\u00e4ffli teaches poster design, narrative design, and typography at the Lucerne School of Graphic Design.",
