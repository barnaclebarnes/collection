    "biography": "The pottery S. Hancock & Sons was formed in 1857, initially in Tunstall, then in Stoke and then in Hanley.  It produced primarily earthenware goods, and began to produce china in 1920.  One of its main decorative ranges was Morris Ware, much of which resembled Moorcroft work. The company closed in 1937 (Sigman Collection Notes Biography, July 2013).",
