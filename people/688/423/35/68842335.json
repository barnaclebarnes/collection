He began working at Walter Dorwin Teague Associates in 1938. Pens, pencils, and the Polaroid Executive desk lamp were among his early design projects. He remained with the Teague firm for over four decades, eventually specializing in aircraft design, particularly passenger jet interiors for planes like the Boeing 707 and 747. In 1972 he became president and chief executive of the firm, retiring from the post ten years later. He then served as chairman until 1987.",
