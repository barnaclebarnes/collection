    "biography": "The London-based design studio Wallace Sewell was established by Harriet Wallace-Jones and Emma Sewell after graduating from the Royal College of Art in 1990. Both women trained as weavers, and all of their products are designed by hand on the loom. The specifications are sent to the mill, and the fabrics are  woven on power looms, with careful attention given to maintaining the qualities of a hand-weave. Most of their yarns are sourced from British companies, and are woven in Lancashire. The studio also works with a finisher in Yorkshire.\nIn addition to their line of fashion and home accessories, Wallace Sewell has created fabrics for the London Underground and Overground trains, Croydon trams and the East London Transit.",
