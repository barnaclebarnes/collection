    "biography": "Jeanne Gang is a graduate of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, and is the founder and principal of Studio Gang Architects (est. 1997), a Chicago-based team of architects, designers, and thinkers whose projects discuss contemporary issues. The work from Studio Gang ranges from private residences to community facilities. The creative thinkers at Studio Gang have produced some of today\u2019s most innovative work that has been inspired by curiosity and intelligence. Gang\u2019s most exemplary work are recent projects, such as the Aqua Tower, which was named Emporis Skyscraper of the Year in 2009, the Northerly Island framework plan, Nature Boardwalk at Lincoln Park Zoo, and Columbia College Chicago\u2019s Media Production Center. \n\nStudio Gang\u2019s architectural work stems from Jeanne\u2019s breadth of knowledge about architectural forms and concepts, which together create a compelling whole. She seeks design solutions through investigations and collaborations across several disciplines. Her outstanding portfolio has been exhibited internationally, most notably at the International Venice Biennale, MoMA, the National Building Museum, and the Art Institute of Chicago. Jeanne has taught studios at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and IIT, focusing on cities, ecologies, materials, and technologies.",
