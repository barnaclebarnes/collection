Born in Littleborough, Lancashire, Burrill studied Graphic Design at Leeds Polytechnic and the Royal College of Art.  Working in print, installation, and moving image, Burrill\u2019s work often features witty yet commonplace slogans set in bold types and bright colors.  Traditional printmaking techniques such as wood block printing, letterpress and screenprint are integral parts of Burrill\u2019s design process and aesthetic.  His commercial practice has included advertising campaigns and posters for The Economist magazine, the British Library, the London Underground, The Design Museum, London, and Colette, Paris.  His work has been exhibited at the Graphic Design Museum at Breda, Kemistry Gallery, London, The Victoria & Albert Museum, London, and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.",
