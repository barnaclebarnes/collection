    "biography": "Byung-Hoon Choi is a pioneer of sculptural art furniture design in his native Korea.  Choi strives to create works of design that transcend the traditional boundaries of functionality, while simultaneously evoking Korean cultural symbols.  He was one of several artist\/designers who promoted a modern approach to traditional Korean furniture in the second half of the 20th century.  Choi often uses seemingly contradictory shapes or materials in a single design, but he employs stone, a signature element, to establish a unity and tranquility within each work.  His designs are often derived from nature, incorporating the natural world through both material and form.  His work is included in the collections of a number of institutions in South Korea, including the National Museum of Contemporary Art, Seoul and the Seoul Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as in the Vitra Design Museum, Weil am Rhein, Germany.",
