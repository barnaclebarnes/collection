    "biography": "Dale Chihuly is, arguably, the most recognizable name in the American studio glass movement. Rather approaching each piece as a solitary glass blower, he employs teams of artisans to work the glass. This innovative approach to production has enabled Chihuly to escalate the size of his glass installations to the monumental. Since the 1970s, Chihuly has developed a distinctive vocabulary of glass forms and colors while continuing to innovate through his numerous public and private commissions. His works have taken over public spaces as diverse as The New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx and the Tower of David in Jerusalem, and have brought an increased interest to glass as both a decorative and functional medium.",
