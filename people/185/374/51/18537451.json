    "biography": "The Chase Brass and Copper Company was founded in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 1876 by Henry Sabin Chase. The company became one of the largest brass manufacturers in the city and continued to expand throughout the early 20th century, acquiring additional companies for the production of copper. The firm produced consumer and industrial products including buttons, novelties, copper pipe and plumbing supplies. During the 1930s, when demand for these types of goods declined due to the Great Depression, Chase, seeking to increase its business, entered the consumer market with a line of modern household goods made of chrome-plated metal, copper, and brass. The stylish, streamlined wares were created by some of the leading industrial designers of the day, including Russel Wright, Lurelle Guild, and Walter Von Nessen. This specialty product line resulted in more than 500 decorative accessory, tableware, and lighting, designs, and lasted for twelve years. Chase discontinued the line in the early 1940s when the company was engaged by the US government to produce war materials, such as shell and gun casings, during World War II. Chase moved from Waterbury in 1975. Today, Brass Chase and Copper Company, LLC is based in Montpelier, Ohio.",
