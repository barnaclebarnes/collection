    "biography": "Edith Brown was one of the founders of the Saturday Evening Girls Club, a foundation started as the result of the belief that women\u2019s lives needed to be improved in the late 19th century. The SEG would eventually turn into Paul Revere Pottery.  Brown was an artist who was born in Nova Scotia and moved to Boston in the early 1890s. She attended the Museum School where she met Edith Guerrier, a librarian and writer.  Edith Brown and Edith Guerrier, along with their benefactor, Helen Storrow, wanted to help women find a stronger voice in American society. They looked to the Arts and Crafts Movement as a way to bring together the creativity of female artists. The Society of Arts and Crafts, Boston, elected Brown to Crafstman in 1909 and then Mastercraftsman in 1913. Paul Revere Pottery achieved Mastership into the Society in 1917.",
