In 2002, the company was hired by DARPA, the U.S. military\u2019s research arm, to research and develop noise-eliminating technology that was capable of facilitating communication between soldiers in dangerously loud environments. Jawbone created the NoiseAssassin technology, a military-grade noise-cancelling system. The company also began to develop wearable technology and audio devices for the commercial market, notable for their technical innovation, ease-of-use and sophistication of design. Their products include the award-winning Jawbone ERA and ICON Bluetooth headsets, and new products such as the JAMBOX wireless speaker and speakerphone, as well as the UP wristband activity tracker and app.",
