It was a family-run factory that produced other wares using Kayser & Sohn as a mark, but gave a specific name, \u201cKayserzinn,\u201d for its Art Nouveau pewter\u2014perhaps a play on the idea that it could be the Kaiser\u2019s (or Emperor\u2019s) pewter. In 1894, Engelbert Kayser set up a design workshop that supplied about 800 different designs that were produced by the factory in Krefeld, Germany.",
